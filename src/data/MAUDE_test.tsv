1359124	1	in connection with the use of the caresuite family of medical device data systems, it was reported that manual patient allergy data entries into our end user application were overwritten during automatic updates of patient data from the hospital information system. this configuration contributed to a patient incident, resulting in a temporary allergic reaction (shortness of breath) to a prescribed medication order of toradol. the incident was mitigated through normal clinical practice. the patient was able to proceed with their scheduled surgery, without further effects. an improper configuration of the interface database contributed to the incident, by allowing automatic third party his/cis updates to the end user application, where manual updates are in practice. customers preferring this practice should not link the interface database to their his/cis. the reporting customer site has been reconfigured to support their preferred practice. there have been no other reports of adverse patient impact associated with this issue. nonetheless, during the course of our current investigation we've received one additional site report of allergy data being overwritten. >< our investigation into the reported incident revolved around how our medical device data system interfaces work in populating caresuite end user applications with his/cis data. the caresuite family applications are delivered with 'standard' linked allergy fields. by default, these fields are configured to import data from other vendor systems, and/or to transfer data within the caresuite applications. when implementing these applications, sites must decide whether the his or caresuite is the master of the allergy and precaution data. data must not be entered through both systems in order to maintain the integrity of the data. the situation is that patient demographic data fields for allergies and precautions can be entered into care suite applications in two ways: locally by the end user or externally via an his/adt interface. our methodology is that the his is the default master. the following scenario is possible: patient is booked to go into the or. in the preop application, the pre op nurse enters an allergy. patient record is started in anesthesia and the adt interface downloads allergy information from the his. if the information is the same, then there is no problem. however, if the his allergy field is blank or different, it will overwrite the end user allergy field entered in the preop application (e.g. remove an updated allergy, leave it blank or different). it is currently possible to configure the system to prevent this, and many customers understand that the his is the master by default, but it is possible for this sequence of events to occur. through our clinical training and implementation, picis review with customers how they want to configure allergies. this review includes the fact that interface data from an his will overwrite the data entered into our applications. most customers decide not to bring allergies in through the interface database. however, if the allergy fields are not de-linked from the interface, the described scenario is possible. in developing our corrective action strategy, we have reviewed customer configuration profiles, and evaluated the level of risks associated with usage models. through more detailed understanding of customer configurations, picis has developed a strategy for recommended system interface reconfiguration, to meet our customer needs. to help ensure the most appropriate configuration and integrity of patient data, we have initiated a customer communication to our installed base, explaining the potential source of patient data conflict and to provide support in choosing the appropriate configuration option and implementation.

5851400	1	problem description: following a client complaint, intelerad has identified a software problem in the image fusion module which may display an incorrect calculation of standard uptake value (suv) when loading the presentation state of image for a previously calculated (and saved) region of interest (roi). this problem could lead radiologists to base their diagnosis/report on incorrect anatomical measurements leading to incorrect medical treatment. no patient incident has been reported at this moment - this problem is documented as a precaution. investigation details: one customer complaint ((b)(4)) bug identified: (b)(4). this is a bug due to a missing coordinate transformation, which manifests itself only when the ct axial spacing is not 1mm. most if not all of our testing data to that point had been from ge which had 1mm spacing, so this bug was not seen, until we had a pet/mr dataset with axial spacing not equal to 1mm. even then, the bug as stated was that the max pixel was not in the cubical voi region. we did not note that the max pixel was incorrect for the given region. the bug only applies to restored presentation states; any modification of a voi read from presentation states causes max suv to be calculated correctly the incorrect max suv is that of an adjacent region, so is random, and more than likely not to correspond to the actual region of interest, therefore the error should be noticeable. the displayed suv at the cursor location is correct, contradicting the incorrect max suv. the go to max" associated with the voi will triangulate out of the voi box  indicating that something is wrong. all of the max suvs in the presentation states will be incorrect as above  increasing the likelihood that the error will be noticed the fix ((b)(4)) is available in inteleviewer 4-11-1 and later versions. the investigation was conducted on the client's systems and was reproduced on intelerad's systems (inteleviewer version 4-101-1-p180). assessment of risk to user: description of hazardous situation in use of the device: incorrect calculation of suv when loading presentation state of image for a previously calculated (and saved) roi. this may lead to incorrect diagnosis. this problem is currently documented as a known risk: risk #2.3 in risk management summary (eng-007 issue 21). the mitigation in place reduces the risk for the general case of suv measurements  but not for datasets such as the one that caused the incident  nor the specific use case of displaying a measurement when reloading a presentation state. the risk can be further reduced through additional design factors taking into account specific datasets and the case of reloading the presentation state. probability of risk: before mitigation: occasional (3). after mitigation: remote (2). severity of risk: before mitigation: injury requiring treatment (3) (in the worst case). after mitigation: injury requiring treatment (3) (in the worst case) . detectability (user awareness. if device failure occurs  is it easily recognized by user): the reported incorrect suv is more or less random  so does not correspond to the associated volume. detectability increases with the number of measurements  since the lack of correspondence between incorrect values and associated volumes becomes more obvious. can be recognized in the normal case by trained users. risk vs. benefit comparison (to help determine the recall strategy and type of the recall): reloading a saved presentation state is a basic function of the device. the risk is small compared to the benefit as it is a significant time saver  and normally reduces the risk or errors of repeating measurements by hands. how often does the problem occur? how often can the problem cause direct or indirect harm to the patient? only caused by data where the axial spacing is not 1mm. it may cause harm if it goes undetected  and there is a major discrepancy between the real value and what is displayed  and there is no other means to confirm the diagnosis before the patient is treated. the device has been in use for two years with only a single reported incident  with no indication of real harm. describe the factors that may contribute to product risk to the patient problem occurs for patient high/low resolution ct or mr scans where axial resolution is != 1  and where patient measurements are stored for later reload. factors that may contribute to product risk (i.e. device design  manufacturing problems  or use error): as above. risk assessment summary: function: display previously saved suv measurement. failure mode/defect: incorrect suv displayed. local effect: incorrect measurement  leading to incorrect diagnosis if undetected. system effect: none. adverse health consequences: incorrect diagnosis leading to incorrect treatment if undetected  resulting in harm from incorrect treatment or missing/delayed treatment. severity: 3 injury requiring treatment. probability: 3 occasional. risk rating: medium. corrective action: removing the affected version will prevent users from encountering the problem. proposed recall action: intelerad will: identify all clients affected  i.e. all clients with access to the image fusion module of intelepacs - 31 august 2016. inform all concerned clients of the issue (recall letter) - 31 august 2016. provide all clients that do not already have a fixed version of the device with a software update - 30 september 2016. estimated completion date of the proposed recall action is end of september 2016."

AT THE INSTALLATION STEP TO SELECT CF CARD, THE MANUFACTURER REP PRESENT INDICATED THE CF CARD WAS NOT AN OPTION TO SELECT. RESEATING THE FLASHCARD DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE VERSION 7.1 FLASHCARD WAS INSERTED INTO THE HANDHELD, AND A HARD RESET WAS PERFORMED. THE SCREEN WAS FROZEN AT "CLEAR ALL DATA IN MEMORY" SCREEN, AND NONE OF THE BUTTONS WOULD WORK. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE HANDHELD AND SOFTWARE FLASHCARD WERE RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED VERSION 8.0 FLASHCARD AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS VERIFIED. THE CAUSE FOR THE EVENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A DEFECTIVE FLASHCARD. A VISUAL ANALYSIS OF THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD (PCB) IDENTIFIED THAT PIN 27 WAS NOT SOLDERED ONTO THE PCB CAUSING THE HANDHELD TO NOT RECOGNIZE THE FLASHCARD WHEN IT WAS INSERTED. ONCE THE PIN WAS SOLDERED ONTO THE PCB, NO FURTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED. ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD REVEALED NO ANOMALIES AND PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE VERSION 7.1 FLASHCARD REVEALED NO ANOMALIES AND PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

1003068	1	there have been no reports of actual harm to patients. the product generates a report, which is then available: co systems are presently not classified as medical devices. however, any time there is data discrepancy, with clinical content elements being unavailable to the end-user, there is some potential for harm. in this particular circumstance, dealing solely with the nuclear cardiology report manager, the data elements involved are certainly not the sole determinants for clinical decision making, so the potential for harm is low. however, if the situation were to recur, with more clinically significant data elements being unavailable for clinical review, the clinical end-user of the co report might make clinical decisions that could contribute to serious injury. complicating the issue is that the co report is presented in the co to a wide variety of users, some of which are not well versed in the field of cardiology (e.g. emergency department physicians). for example, if the 'conclusions' section is not available in the his report, the final recommendations would not be available for an end-user who is not expert with the more technical elements of a cardiology study. this could prompt a repeat diagnostic study, with attendant risks (e.g. administration of contrast material, causing allergic reaction or renal failure). agfa is being conservative in reporting this product problem. >< product utilizes software, called 'report manager for nuclear reporting, outbound report, version 2.04.20. this software generates a report to be sent to the information system. this report is referred to as the 'outbound' report and is commonly retrieved from a sites his for use in patient care. in late 2007, agfa was contacted by a user that information available from the product, and present in a separate report (also generated by report manager and stored on the product) was not present in the 'outbound' report. an evaluation by agfa personnel of the request from this user for the additional information determined that based on the potential use of the 'outbound' report by hospital personnel, critical available data should have been included in the design of the 'outbound' report. risk analysis conducted by agfa personnel suggested there is a potential risk of serious injury, due to possible treatment decisions because of lack of known information in this report. information not included in the 'outbound' report is the hemodynamics table, and the conclusions from the nuclear data.

2438425	1	PATIENT'S MONITOR DID NOT ALARM; HOWEVER, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD AN ERRATIC RHYTHM, WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT THIS PATIENT. THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES WITH DIFFERENT PATIENTS ON THIS DATE. BIOMED ADVISED AND ARE WORKING ON THE SITUATION. APPARENTLY THIS IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE WITH THE DASH MONITORS WITH SOFTWARE VERSION 5.4. ADDITIONAL FACT FINDINGS: 1- REWIND BACK TO THE ORIGINAL EVENT OF LAST SUMMER. IF YOU ANALYZE THE FREQUENCY OF THE QRS'S ON THE GRAPH PAPER YOU WOULD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE, NOT EVEN WITH A PEDIATRIC PATIENT. THIS ANALYSIS WAS CONFIRMED TO BE CORRECT BY GE. 2- THE SYMPTOMS FOR THESE EVENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL EVENT. GE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE TWO ISSUES TO BE THE SAME. HOWEVER WHAT APPEARS TO BE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO GE IS THE CPU BOARD MANUFACTURING AND REVISION VERSIONS. THE ORIGINAL ISSUE WAS RELATED TO CPU BOARDS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN JANUARY 2003 AND JANUARY 2007. THESE EVENTS (SEVEN CURRENT ONES) OCCURRED WITH DASH MONITORS HAVING CPU BOARDS MANUFACTURED POST JANUARY 2007.3-  PROBLEM DEFINED: ACCORDING TO GE THIS ISSUE IS DEFINITELY A DASH PROBLEM, HARDWARE RELATED. IT IS NOT PHYSIOLOGICAL/PATIENT ISSUE. IT IS CAUSED BY HIGH NETWORK TRAFFIC OVERHEATING A COMPONENT (ETHERNET CHIP) ON THE CPU BOARD, WHICH IN TURN CAUSES THE WAVEFORM TO BE CONDENSED. THE MONITOR DOES NOT ALARM WHEN THIS HAPPENS, SINCE PROCESSING HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE. "ARRHYTHMIA PROCESSING" WOULD HAVE SEEN THE CORRECT PATIENT RHYTHM BUT SOMEHOW WAS DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY BY THE DASH MONITOR.4- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES RELATES TO THE NEWER CPU BOARD TYPE WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT ORIGINAL SOFTWARE VERSION. THE LATEST SOFTWARE VERSION IS NOT THE SAME AS OLDER VERSION CAUSING POTENTIAL FOR USER INTERFACE ERRORS.

938372	0	(b)(4). concomitant medical products: cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list # 8h49-02. in the previously submitted medwatch -01 follow up, the customer complaint was inadvertently not associated with remedial action correction 2919069-8/6/07-004-c in error. the customer used the suspect device at the customer facility. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number 8h49-02, was manufactured on (b)(4) 2007 and was identified by (b)(4) to have been manufactured with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the tip of the syringe plunger. the affected syringes with a package date of (b)(4) 2007 through (b)(4) 2007, caused the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer to generate an error message upon installation of the syringe or shortly thereafter. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe was distributed for the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer only and did not impact other cell-dyn analyzers. the issue was resolved when a new cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list 8h49-04, was manufactured by (b)(4) and released for distribution on (b)(4) 2009. >< the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe is used on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer, an automated hematology analyzer. the vendor for the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number 08h49-02 provided abbott laboratories with an improved version of the syringe, which was released for use on 5/8/2007. the vendor sent a letter to abbott stating the hemoglobin syringes with a specific manufacturing code, were assembled with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the plunger tip. the absence of sufficient lubricant causes premature failure of the syringe, which generated 'syringe failed to home' error messages upon installation on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer or shortly thereafter. in response to the vendor's letter, abbott internal nonconformance was addressed via stock sweeps to segregate non-conforming product in inventory. a world wide quality hold was issued 22 june 2007 to remove suspect product from the distribution system and a customer letter was generated to users of the cell-dyn sapphire analyzers. the defective syringes were identified in the customer letter as those packaged and shipped between 08 may 2007 and 25 june 2007. a review of abbott's complaint analysis system from january 2007 to present did not indicate an adverse trend for hemoglobin syringes. as the affected syringes did not meet the vendor's internal lubricant requirements, the vendor provided the following corrective actions: vendor employee retraining for syringe lubricant application was completed on 6/19/07. one hundred percent part inspection of the syringe will be performed and inspection results will be attached to the syringe shipment. abbott syringe specifications were defined for use by the vendor. certification documents are attached on every shipment of syringes. this is the final report. >< the customer contacted abbott to report observing cell-dyn sapphire 'syringe failed to home' error messages on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer. the customer cleared the message fault, cleaned the syringe which showed no signs of leaking and re-assayed samples with no suspect results. the abbott customer technical advocate advised the customer to remove the syringe to assess syringe plunger movement and replace if indicated. about a week later, the customer contacted abbott to report the sapphire hemoglobin syringe was 'frozen' and could not be moved when cleaning procedures were preformed. a new syringe was installed and all quality control levels were within range and the syringe issue was resolved. there was no impact to patient management reported by the customer.
1784728	0	ON (B)(6) 2010, THE DATEX-OHMEDA S/5 AVANCE ANESTHESIA SYSTEM CHECK WAS PERFORMED PRIOR TO THE FIRST CASE OF THE DAY. THE MACHINE, SYSTEM, CIRCUIT AND LOW P LEAK TEST WERE COMPLETED. THE LOW P LEAK TEST WAS COMPLETED WITH THE ORANGE RUBBER DOUBLE ENDED STOPPER IN PLACE. THE ORANGE STOPPER WAS NOT REMOVED PRIOR TO THE START OF THE FIRST ANESTHESIA CASE AND THE BREATHING CIRCUIT WAS CONNECTED TO THE ORANGE STOPPER. FOLLOWING THE LOW P LEAK TEST THE NURSE, WHO PERFORMED THE SYSTEM CHECKS, ENTERED THROUGH THE SCREENS TO EXIT THE CHECK. THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST ENTERED THE ROOM TO FIND A START CASE SCREEN AND PROCEEDED TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT CHECK. THE CASE WAS STARTED AND THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST NOTICED THAT SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO VENTILATE THE PT. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ORANGE STOPPER REMAINED IN THE ANESTHESIA MACHINE. AT THAT TIME, THE STOPPER WAS REMOVED IMMEDIATELY AND THE BREATHING CIRCUIT WAS ATTACHED TO THE INSPIRATORY FLOW SENSOR PORT. THERE IS NOT A HARD STOP IN PLACE IN THIS ANESTHESIA MACHINE TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF EVENT TO OCCUR WHEN THE STOPPER REMAINS IN THE CHECK PORT. A SIMPLE REDESIGN OF THE STOPPER WOULD PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

TWO DAYS LATER, THERE WAS AN ELEVATED POTASSIUM LEVEL APPEARING IN THE RESULTS SECTION; BUT THIS WAS NOT SEEN IN A TIMELY MANNER AND CAME AS A SHOCK TO THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WHO HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO DISCHARGE THE PATIENT FROM THE HOSPITAL. THERE IS A TWOFOLD PROBLEM HERE. THE FIRST IS THAT THE ORDER WAS NOT CARRIED OUT BY THE ANCILLARY DEPARTMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND WHEN THE TEST WAS FINALLY DONE, THE RESULTS CAME BACK SILENTLY TO THE MDDS EHR, NO ONE KNEW THEY WERE THERE AND GROSSLY ABNORMAL, WITH POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING IMPLICATIONS. THE DESIGN OF THE EHR AND ITS ORDERING DEVICE ARE FLAWED. THERE IS NO A MECHANISM FOR RECONCILING THE EXECUTION OF ORDERS THAT PROVIDES A LIST OF THOSE THAT WERE NOT DONE; AND THERE IS NOT ANY INDICATION THAT NEW RESULTS HAVE COME IN TO THE MDDS, BOTH OF THESE CAN CAUSE DEATH AND SHOULD BE REMEDIED IMMEDIATELY.
1890103	0	(B)(4). OPERATORS NOTICED A VOLUME DISCREPANCY IN THE COLLECTED WASTE BAG, AS AN INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OF WASTE HAD BEEN COLLECTED COMPARED TO WHAT WAS EXPECTED. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THERE WAS A KINK BELOW THE CCM. THE DISPOSABLE SET WAS RETURNED FOR EVAL. DURING THE KIT INVESTIGATION A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE SEGMENT OF TUBING BETWEEN THE CCM AND 3-LUMEN CONNECTOR SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF KINKING. THIS INDICATES THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NOT MIS-PACKAGED PRIOR TO STERILIZATION DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF A WELL-DEFINED KINK. THE PLASMA LINE KINKING MUST HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY THE SPECIFIC LOADING OF THE DISPOSABLE. UPON DHR INVESTIGATION FOR THIS LOT NUMBER NO EVIDENCE OF MFG ERRORS RELATED TO THIS FAILURE MODE WERE FOUND. >< THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR MDR EVAL PROCESS THAT WERE PROMPTED BY AN FDA INSPECTION. THE CUSTOMER CALLED AND STATED THAT THEY WERE PERFORMING A TPE PROCEDURE AND NOTICED THAT WHILE THEY HAD USED APPROXIMATELY 4L OF REPLACEMENT FLUID THERE IS ONLY ABOUT 1 L (VISUAL) IN THE PLASMA BAG. THEY HAVE DONE PROCEDURES FOR THIS PT BEFORE. ABOUT 35 MINS INTO THE TPE PROCEDURE, THE PT BEGIN TO COMPLAIN OF SOME PAIN AND DISCOMFORT, SOME 'BACK PRESSURE', SOME NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN THE LIPS.

2228167	1	DR (B)(6), ALLEGED THAT THREE PTS UNNECESSARILY HAD DIAGNOSTIC HEART CATHETERIZATION PERFORMED DUE TO HIS INTERPRETATION OF ECG CHARTS OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF LIFESYNC CORP PRODUCT. INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT DETERMINED THAT ONLY ONE PT WAS PRESCRIBED CATHETERIZATION THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND TO HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF BLOCKAGE. NO HARM TO THE PT WAS REPORTED. HOWEVER, THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT THE HOSP ALLEGED THAT THE PROCEDURE WAS UNNECESSARY AND INTRODUCED A HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK TO THE PT. THIS COMPLAINT WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A FAILURE OF THE LIFESYNC LEADWEAR TO MEET A SPECIFICATION OR USER REQUIREMENT. IN THIS CASE, A CARDIOLOGIST AT (B)(6) HOSP ALLEGED THAT THE OUTPUT OF THE ECG DATA USING LIFESYNC LEADWEAR IN ADDITION TO THE PT'S HISTORY OF HEART DISEASE AND APPARENT SYMPTOMS (CHEST PAINS) LED TO THE DETERMINATION THAT THE PT REQUIRED DIAGNOSTIC HEART CATHETERIZATION. FOLLOWING CATHETERIZATION, THE PT WAS NOTED TO HAVE PATENT "CLEAN" ARTERIES. UPON REQUEST BY LIFESYNC; OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE COULD NOT BE PROVIDED REGARDING THE ECG DATA THAT LED TO THE DIAGNOSTIC CATHETERIZATION. HOWEVER, CONVERSATION WITH THE NURSE MGR INDICATED THAT THE PT'S ECG HAD BEEN ANALYZED USING MASON-LIKAR LEAD PLACEMENT AS WELL AS STANDARD 12 LEAD DISTAL PLACEMENT. ACCORDING TO THE NURSE MGR, THE PT WAS ORDERED TO UNDERGO CATHETERIZATION REGARDLESS OF THE LEAD PLACEMENT USED TO OBTAIN THE ECG. NO HARM OCCURRED TO THE PT AS A RESULT OF THE CATHETERIZATION. THE (B)(6) LAB POLICY IS TO USE STANDARD 12 LEAD DISTAL LEAD PLACEMENT. LIFESYNC PRODUCT IS DESIGNED TO BE USED WITH MASON-LIKAR MODIFIED CHEST LEAD POSITIONS. STANDARD 12 LEAD DISTAL LEAD PLACEMENT AND MASON-LIKAR LEAD PLACEMENT HAVE SEVERAL KEY DIFFERENCES INHERENT TO EACH PLACEMENT METHOD THAT LEAD TO VARIATION BETWEEN ECG'S OBTAINED BY EITHER METHOD. AN ECG OBTAINED WITH MASON-LIKAR PLACEMENT SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED THE SAME AS AN ECG OBTAINED USING 12-LEAD DISTAL PLACEMENT. PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, LIFESYNC CORP PROVIDED APPLICATION NOTES AND PRODUCT LABELING TO ALL CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING (B)(6)) DETAILING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MASON-LIKAR PLACEMENT AND STANDARD 12 LEAD DISTAL PLACEMENT AS WELL AS APPLICATION NOTES THAT PROVIDE INSTRUCTION FOR CONTINUOUS ST SEGMENT MONITORING USING MASON-LIKAR LEAD PLACEMENT.

THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD AND IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE HANDHELD WOULD NOT POWER ON. THE CAUSE FOR THE ANOMALY IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SWOLLEN MAIN BATTERY THAT PREVENTED MAIN BATTERY COVER FROM SEATING PROPERLY AND REGISTERING A FALSE OPEN BATTERY LATCH CONDITION (REPORTED ON MFR. REPORT # 1644487-2013-00521). ALTHOUGH THE MAIN BATTERY WAS SWOLLEN, IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD A CHARGE AND POWER THE HANDHELD FOR OVER AN HOUR. ALSO DURING THE ANALYSIS IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE SERIAL CABLE HAD AN OPEN ELECTRICAL CONNECTION IN THE POWER CABLE. AS A RESULT OF THE OPEN WIRE CONNECTION, THE HANDHELD WOULD RECEIVE POWER FROM THE AC ADAPTER INTERMITTENTLY. PRODUCT ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE BREAK IN THE SERIAL DATA CABLE IS UNKNOWN. IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE HANDHELD DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE ANYMORE AND MUST BE PLUGGED INTO THE OUTLET IN ORDER TO USE IT. THE MANUFACTURER'S CONSULTANT ATTEMPTED TO CHARGE THE HANDHELD USING HIS POWER ADAPTER FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT THE DEVICE STILL WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE.

2113344	1	THANK YOU FOR LOOKING INTO THIS EVENT. "THIS IS SCENARIO #2 POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING EVENT DUE TO VERY QUESTION RAISED POSSIBILITY AN UNNECESSARY CESAREAN SECTION OCCURRED DUE TO SUSPECTED SEVERE FLAWS AND CONTRADICTIONS AND UNREPORTED FLAWS IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL ON THE PHILIPS AVALON FM FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM -RECALL NUMBER Z-0552-2010- CATALOG NUMBER: M2705A. PT IDENTIFIER IS PT'S CHART NUMBER AT (B)(6) IN (B)(6). I AM UNABLE TO SEND THE ACTUAL FETAL MONITOR STRIP WITH NOTES FROM THE FETAL MONITOR COMPUTER OR ANYTHING FROM THE ACTUAL PT'S CHART AS IN SCENARIO #1 BUT AGAIN (B)(6), DIRECTOR OF NURSING WOULD BE GLAD TO ASSIST THE FDA WITH THIS POTENTIAL LIFE THREATENING FLAW NOT JUST IN THIS CASE BUT IN CURRENT AND FUTURE CASES WHERE THE MONITOR IS IN USE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY AS I WILL ATTEMPT TO PROVE AND RAISE SERIOUS DOUBT WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM IN AT LEAST ONE OF 200 STRIPS OUT OF 450. I WAS ABLE TO REVIEW WHILE THIS FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM WAS IN PLACE AT MY FACILITY THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE FDA IN FAX AND MAILED MYSELF, (B)(6), RN IN (B)(6) 2010 WITH NO REPLY THUS FAR FROM THE FDA. (B)(6) CAN BE REACHED AT (B)(6) AND ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR LOOKING INTO THIS POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING MATTER IN THIS MEDICAL DEVICE FOR BOTH MOTHER AND BABY. THIS FETAL MONITOR STRIP FOR PURPOSES OF THIS REPORT SHALL BEGIN AT THE TIME 2010 MARK ON (B)(6) 2009. THE MATERNAL HEART RATE IS ABOVE 100, THE PULSE OXIMETER IS IN USE AS OUTLINED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL ON THIS FETAL MONITOR AND THE "CCV" SYSTEM IS ENABLE BY THE COMPUTER GENERATING "COINCIDENCE STATUS ON" BUT INSTEAD OF THE 10-15 BEAT DIFFERENCE TO BE INVESTIGATED BY VERIFYING FETAL HEART TONES AS OUTLINED ON PAGES ONE AND TWO OF THE CLASS 2 RECALL. THE BEAT DIFFERENCE IS ACTUALLY 10-25 BEAT DIFFERENCE. HOWEVER, THERE IS A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE PLACED AT 2055 WHICH IS ONE OF THE VERIFICATION OF FETAL HEART TONES AS OUTLINED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL. NOTICE, HOWEVER, THE "CCV" SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE EMPLOYED AND THE MONITOR CONTINUES TO READ AND PRINT OUT "COINCIDENCE STATUS ON" WITH THE SAME 10-25 BEAT DIFFERENCE IN MATERNAL AND FETAL HEART TONES AS WELL AS 10-30 SECOND DELAY THAT IS NOT DISCUSSED AT ALL IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL. THE DELAY IS MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL MANUAL AS BEING UP TO A 6 SECOND DELAY. THIS WAS A QUESTION BROUGHT UP BY MYSELF ONCE AGAIN TO LEAD APPLICATION SPECIALIST FROM PHILIPS HEALTHCARE ON (B)(6) 2010 AT (B)(6) WITH MYSELF, (B)(6) -DIRECTOR OF MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH AT THE TIME- AND (B)(6) FROM BIOMED PRESENT. (B)(6) FROM PHILIPS STATED HOWEVER THAT THIS COULD BE "UP TO A 10 SECOND DELAY" IF SO, WHY IS THAT CHANGE NOT MENTIONED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL? ALSO, IT IS CLEAR AS IN THIS FETAL MONITOR STRIP THAT IT IS ACTUALLY A 10-30 SECOND DELAY WHICH IN THIS CASE CAUSES AN APPEARANCE OF "LATE DECELS" THAT ARE VERIFIED WITH A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE ON THIS POTENTIALLY COMPUTER LIFE THREATENING FLAW TO THE UNBORN FETUS AS THE FETAL HEART TONES ARE VERIFIED BUT THE COMPUTER CONTINUES AS "COINCIDENCE STATUS ON" WHICH IS A STRONG IDENTIFIER THAT THE MATERNAL HEART RATE CONTINUED TO BE DUPLICATED INSTEAD OF THE MOTHER AND FETUS. SO IT IS CLEAR THAT EVEN WITH VERIFYING FETAL HEART TONES AS OUTLINED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL THAT THE "CCV" SYSTEM CONTINUES TO READ "COINCIDENCE STATUS ON" WHEN MATERNAL HEART RATE IS ABOVE 100 AND THE COMPUTER IS RECEIVING THAT IT IS PICKING UP THE SAME HEART RATE TWICE WHICH IN THIS CASE IS PROBABLY MATERNAL. SO, QUITE HONESTLY WAS BABY EVER MONITORED AT ALL DUE TO THE FLAWS OF THIS FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM? THIS WAS A GOOD OUTCOME FOR THIS INFANT BUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH FUTURE INFANTS IN THIS SAME QUESTIONABLY FLAWED FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM? IT IS NOT MY INTENT TO PLACE JUDGEMENT AT ALL, I AM HONESTLY RAISING THE SERIOUS QUESTIONS OF DOUBT HERE AND ASKING FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND EVAL BY THE FDA. BY CONTINUING TO SEE "COINCIDENCE STATUS ON" EVEN AFTER THE SCALP ELECTRODE IS PLACED, THE MONITOR ITSELF IS QUESTIONING THAT IT IS THE SAME MATERNAL HEART RATE BUT WITH A 10-25 BEAT DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS A 10-30 SECOND DELAY WITH MIMICKING FEATURES, HOW CAN ANY SKILLED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING WHEN ALL THE CLASS 2 RECALL GUIDELINES ARE BEING FOLLOWED. WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL FETAL HEART RATE? I WANTED TO ADD HERE ALSO THAT NEITHER THE ORIGINAL MANUAL OR THE CLASS 2 RECALL MENTION THAT THE "CCV" FEATURE IS TO EVEN REMAIN EMPLOYED WITH A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE BUT THIS FETAL MONITORING STRIP CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES IT AS OCCURRING IN THIS INSTANCE, AND JUST IN CASE THIS QUESTION IS RAISED BY PHILIPS, HEALTHCARE. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY TIME A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME POTENTIAL "CCV" FLAWS. I HAVE OTHER EXAMPLES OUT OF THE 200 STRIPS I REVIEWED OF THE 450 WHILE THEIR FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM WAS IN PLACE. MAY I ALSO ADD IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME MONITOR OF THE 7 DOING THIS PRESENTATION OF THIS POTENTIAL FLAW, SO PLEASE DON'T BLAME IT ON JUST ONE OF THE 7 FETAL MONITORS MALFUNCTIONING OR THE SAME FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE CABLE MALFUNCTIONING, IT WAS SEVERAL OF THEM THAT DO THIS WITH A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE IN PLACE BUT THIS WAS THE BEST EXAMPLE AND LENGTH AND AFFECTED OUTCOME FOR THIS SCENARIO #2. THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THIS FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM THAT I LOVE. IT TELLS THE USER WHICH MONITOR THEIR ON AND WHICH CABLE IS IN USE SO AS TO BETTER BE ABLE TO TRACK DOWN A FAULTY MONITOR OR CABLE, SO THE QUESTIONS ARE RAISED. UNNECESSARY CESAREAN SECTION DUE TO A FETAL MONITOR FLAW OR FLAWS EVEN WITH ALL THE MFRS GUIDELINES AND CLASS 2 GUIDELINES FOLLOWED? IF MATERNAL HEART RATE CONTINUES TO BE DUPLICATED WITH THESE SEPARATING RATES AND DELAYED RATE FEATURES IN FUTURE DELIVERIES WILL THE OUTCOME BE AS GOOD? AND IF THE IDEA THAT UNNECESSARY SURGERY WAS PERFORMED DUE TO THIS MEDICAL DEVICE POTENTIAL MALFUNCTIONS THIS PUT THE MOTHER AT A LIFE THREATENING RISK JUST AS ANY SURGERY DOES AND PROLONGED HER HOSPITALIZATION NOT TO MENTION THE POTENTIAL OF HEMORRHAGE THAT ALWAYS EXIST, INFECTION RISK, UNNECESSARY PAIN WITH SURGERY. I ALSO WANTED TO ADD THAT ON THE CONVERSATION WITH (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 2010, I ASKED THE QUESTION AS THE COMPUTER CONTINUES TO SAY "COINCIDENCE STATUS ON". AT WHAT POINT WILL IT ACTUALLY AUDIBLY ALARM AT THE NURSES' STATION? THE REPLY WAS "IF 80% OF ANY ONE MINUTE TIME FRAME IN ACTUAL MONITORING OF MATERNAL AND FETAL HEART RATES COINCIDE, THEN THE AUDIBLE ALARM WILL ALARM." HOW IS THIS EVER POSSIBLE WITH SEPARATION OF DUPLICATED HEART RATES EVEN WHEN BOTH ARE MOTHER'S HEART RATE AND DELAYED? DATE OF USE: (B)(6) 2009 - (B)(6) 2010. 
2874363	0	DURING A REVIEW OF PROGRAMMING HISTORY, IT WAS NOTED THAT A MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTIC TEST ON (B)(6) 2010 RESULTED IN A LOW OUTPUT CURRENT. THE LOW OUTPUT CURRENT WARNING ON THE MAGNET MODE TEST IS A RESULT OF THE USER NOT SWIPING THE MAGNET BEFORE PERFORMING THE MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTICS TEST. THE LOW OUTPUT CURRENT RESULT IS LIKELY DUE TO THE GENERATOR COMPARING THE LAST MAGNET SWIPE OUTPUT TO THE NEWLY PROGRAMMED MAGNET MODE OUTPUT CURRENT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN DELIVERED YET. THE "MAGNET COUNT" VARIABLE WAS NOT BEING UPDATED UPON INITIAL INTERROGATION OF THE GENERATOR. THE MAGNETCOUNT WAS OBTAINED FROM THE LAST PROGRAMMING SESSION ON THE HANDHELD FROM THE LAST GENERATOR. THE REASON THE WARNING MESSAGE WAS NOT DISPLAYED THAT A MAGNET SWIPE HAD NOT BEEN DETECTED IS DUE TO THE WAY THE HANDHELD SOFTWARE OBTAINS THE MAGNETCOUNT VARIABLE TO DETERMINE IF THE MESSAGE SHOULD BE DISPLAYED. THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN V8.0 SOFTWARE UPGRADE OF THE HANDHELD COMPUTERS. IT PROVIDED A SOFTWARE FIX FOR SCENARIOS IN WHICH PERFORMING A MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTIC WITHOUT PERFORMING A MAGNET SWIPE WILL NOT RESULT IN THE WARNING MESSAGE THAT A MAGNET SWIPE WAS NOT DETECTED. THE HIGH IMPEDANCE EVENT IS CAPTURED IN MFR REPORT #1644487-2010-00815. ANALYSIS OF PROGRAMMING HISTORY.

3632939	0	IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS NOT WORKING DUE TO COMMUNICATION ISSUES. THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WOULD WORK INTERMITTENTLY AND THE COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES WERE CONFIRMED ON A DEMO DEVICE. THE 9V BATTERY WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES. THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER WHERE THE FAILURE TO PROGRAM WAS CONFIRMED AND ATTRIBUTED TO AN INTERMITTENT CONDUCTOR IN THE SERIAL DATA CABLE. ONCE THE CABLE WAS SUBSTITUTED, ALL COMMUNICATION ERRORS CLEARED. NO ISSUES WITH THE RETURNED FLASHCARD WERE NOTED. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED HANDHELD, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT SOME OF THE SYNC CABLE CONNECTOR LEADS WERE DAMAGED AND THAT THE SOLDER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SYNC CABLE CONNECTOR LEADS AND THE PCB WERE CRACKED. BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE, THE HANDHELD WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE POWER FROM THE AC ADAPTER. THE CAUSE FOR THE DAMAGE TO THE CONNECTOR AND SOLDER CONNECTIONS IS MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH MISHANDLING OF THE DEVICE AS IT APPEARS THE CONNECTOR DETENTS ARE NOT BEING COMPRESSED WHEN REMOVING OR MANIPULATING THE SERIAL DATA CABLE, THUS PLACING AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF FORCE ON THE PCB AND ATTACHED CABLE RECEPTACLE. IT WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT THE SERIAL CABLE WAS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION USING A KNOWN GOOD WAND AND THE RETURNED HANDHELD. THE CAUSE FOR THE COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES IS ASSOCIATED WITH A BROKEN WIRE CONNECTION ON THE AXIM CONNECTOR PLUG PCB. ONCE THE WIRE WAS SOLDERED BACK ONTO THE DELL AXIM CONNECTOR PLUG PCB, THE SERIAL CABLE WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HANDHELD AND WAND. THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE WIRE BREAKS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH MISHANDLING OF THE SERIAL CABLE. THE COMMUNICATION ERRORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERMITTENT CONDUCTOR IN THE WAND WILL BE REPORTED VIA ALTERNATE SUMMARY REPORTING.><DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

2822305	1	ON (B)(6), THE CUSTOMER CALLED INTO BAXA TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO STATE A PT HAD RECEIVED AN UNDER DOSE OF CALCIUM GLUCONATE. THE ERROR IN THE PT多S ORDER WAS A RESULT OF THE PHARMACIST ENTERING THE INCORRECT CALCIUM CONCENTRATION IN THE FORMULARY; 100 MG/ML INSTEAD OF 9.3 MG/ML. THEREFORE, WHEN THE PHARMACIST REQUESTED 35 MG OF CALCIUM, ONLY 3.5 MLS WAS DELIVERED TO THE PT. UPON DISCOVERY OF THE USER ENTRY ERROR, THE PT多S TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION (TPN) THERAPY WAS HALTED. A REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMER多S FORMULARY REVEALED THAT THE ABACUS SOFTWARE OPERATED AS INTENDED. NO ADVERSE EVENTS OR PATIENT INJURY OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE PARTIAL INFUSION. RESULTS - BAXA TECHNICAL SUPPORT REVIEW OF THE FACILITY多S DATABASE SHOWS THAT UPON THE INSTALLATION OF THE ABACUS SOFTWARE, THE CALCIUM GLUCONATE 100 MG/ML INGREDIENT WAS NOT IN THE FORMULA. DATA SHOWS THAT WHEN THE CALCIUM GLUCONATE 100 MG/ML INGREDIENT WAS ADDED TO THE CUSTOMER多S FORMULA BY THE CUSTOMER AT SOME POINT FOLLOWING THE BAXA SUPPLIED INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION; IT WAS CREATED AND SET TO 多UNAVAILABLE多, WHICH PREVENTED USERS FROM ACCESSING THE INGREDIENT. ONLY IN (B)(6) 2011, WAS THE ERRANT ENTRY MADE 多AVAILABLE TO ROUTINE USERS AND WAS NOT REPORTED TO BAXA UNTIL THIS (B)(6) INCIDENT. THIS SUBMISSION IS BEING RETROACTIVELY SUBMITTED SINCE THE INITIAL SUBMISSION WAS MISTAKENLY SUBMITTED TO THE FDA ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS GATEWAY TEST ENVIRONMENT RATHER THAN THE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. DEFECT AWARENESS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FOR ALL EMPLOYEES SUBMITTING ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO PREVENT FUTURE RECURRENCE OF THIS ISSUE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL ALSO SEND PAPER COPIES TO ENSURE ALL SUBMISSIONS ARE SUCCESSFULLY RECEIVED PER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. DURING A REVIEW OF THE FACILITY多S DATABASE THE FOLLOWING WAS DISCOVERED. WHEN THE USER FACILITY INITIALLY ADDED THE CALCIUM GLUCONATE 100 MG/ML INGREDIENT TO THEIR FORMULA, IT WAS ENTERED WITH THE INCORRECT CONCENTRATION OF CALCIUM (100 MG/ML INSTEAD OF 9.3 MG/ML) BUT WAS MADE UNAVAILABLE FOR COMPOUNDING. THE INCORRECT INGREDIENT APPEARS IN TWO OF THE FACILITY多S TEMPLATES, 多ION-BALANCING多 AND 多NICU FLUIDS (TEST)多. EVERY TPN THAT WAS CREATED USING EITHER TEMPLATE WAS COMPOUNDED WITH A LOWER THAN ORDERED AMOUNT OF CALCIUM GLUCONATE SINCE(B)(6) 2011. THIS EVENT ON (B)(6) IS THE ONLY INSTANCE OF MEDICAL INTERVENTION, TO DATE, NO FURTHER PATIENT INVOLVED CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM THIS FACILITY RELATED TO THIS ERROR. BAXA TECHNICAL SUPPORT RESOLVED THE ISSUE WITH THE CUSTOMER DURING THE INITIAL CALL, BY CORRECTING THE CONCENTRATION OF THE CALCIUM GLUCONATE INGREDIENT. A REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMER多S FORMULA REVEALED THAT THE ABACUS SOFTWARE OPERATED AS INTENDED AND THE CAUSE OF THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE INCORRECT INGREDIENT CONCENTRATION ENTERED BY THE CUSTOMER IN THEIR FORMULA. A REVIEW OF THE RISK DOCUMENTATION WAS PERFORMED, AND IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT OCCURRING WITH GREATER FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY THAN ANTICIPATED. ION BALANCING: ION BALANCING IS A PROCESS THAT ACCEPTS DOSE SPECIFICATIONS FOR ELECTROLYTES IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL IONS. THE IONS CONSIDERED ARE: SODIUM (NA+), POTASSIUM (K+), CALCIUM (CA2+), MAGNESIUM (MG2+), PHOSPHATE (PO43-), ACETATE (AC-), AND CHLORIDE (CI-). ABACUS DEVELOPS THE APPROPRIATE COMBINATION OF SALT SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE THE NET CHARGE BALANCE USING THE CHOSEN ANION BALANCE METHOD. THIS 多FLOAT多 ION SERVES TO ACHIEVE THE FINAL BALANCE, BASED ON THE DEMAND FOR OTHER IONS IN THE SOLUTION. THE FLOAT ION WILL BE EITHER CHLORIDE, ACETATE OR A RATIO OF THE TWO. SALT BASED ORDERING: METHOD THAT WILL BE USED TO ORDER SALTS. IF USERS ELECT THE SALT-BASED ORDERING METHOD, THEY WILL ORDER THE AMOUNTS OF THE ELECTROLYTES BASED ON THE SALT SOLUTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE FORMULA. FORMULA: CONTAINS ALL INGREDIENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR COMPOUNDING TPN SOLUTIONS. THERE ARE MANY INGREDIENTS IN THE FORMULA BUT ONLY A SUBSET ARE NEEDED BY MOST ACCOUNTS. TO LIMIT ACCESS TO INGREDIENTS THEY CAN BE MARKED 多UNAVAILABLE多 WHICH LEAVES THE INGREDIENT HIDDEN FROM ORDER ENTRY USERS. 多UNAVAILABLE多 INGREDIENTS CAN BE EDITED, ADDED OR REMOVED WITHOUT IMPACT TO THE ROUTINE USERS. IF AN INGREDIENT IS MADE 多AVAILABLE多 THEN IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR TO EXAMINE THE DATA ENTERED IN THE FORMULA INGREDIENT LIST TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACILITY多S PRACTICES. EACH INGREDIENT HAS A NUMBER OF ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS THAT ARE ADDRESSED IN DETAIL IN THE FORMULA EDITOR. USERS MUST CREATE AN INGREDIENT WITH A CONCENTRATION THAT ADDRESSES EACH ORDER METHOD THEY WILL USE. IF THE USER WISHES TO ORDER AN INGREDIENT BY MASS (GRAMS) AND BY MEQS, THEY MUST CREATE TWO INGREDIENTS; ONE DESCRIBED AS MEQ/ML AND ONE DESCRIBED AS MG/ML. WHEN ORDERED AS A SALT, CALCIUM GLUCONATE IS TYPICALLY FOUND IN FORMULARIES AS MILLIGRAMS OF THE COMBINED CALCIUM AND GLUCONATE SALT BUT WHEN USED AS THE SOURCE FOR CALCIUM IN ION BASED ORDERS, ABACUS REQUIRES THAT THE CALCIUM GLUCONATE INGREDIENT CONTAIN AN ACCURATE ELEMENTAL VALUE OF THE CALCIUM CONTAINED IN THE COMBINED SALT. THIS ENABLES AN ION BASED ORDER TO BE PLACED FOR THE CALCIUM ION RATHER THAN THE SALT CALCIUM GLUCONATE. ONE HUNDRED MG OF CALCIUM GLUCONATE CONTAINS 9.3 MG OF ELEMENTAL CALCIUM. THE ABACUS SOFTWARE PERFORMS CALCULATIONS BASED ON ION PROPERTIES, AND CALCULATES THE MOLAR CONCENTRATION TO THE EQUIVALENT GRAM WEIGHT OF THE ION THAT IS DELIVERED BY A SALT. USING CALCIUM GLUCONATE 10% AS AN EXAMPLE, IF THE USER REQUESTS THAT 100 MG OF THE PRODUCT BE DELIVERED, ABACUS WILL MULTIPLY THE 0.465 MEQ/ML TIMES THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF CALCIUM DIVIDED BY ITS VALENCE TO ARRIVE AT THE MILLIGRAMS OF ELEMENTAL CALCIUM THAT WILL BE DELIVERED PER ML; 0.465 MEQ/ML X 40.08 MG/MMOL/ (VALENCE) = 9.3 MG OF CA2+/ML. USERS CANNOT ORDER THE AMOUNT OF A SALT IN AN ION-BASED FORMULA, BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE WILL CONVERT THE MILLIEQUIVALENT CONCENTRATION TO THE AMOUNT OF THE ELEMENTAL ION. THEREFORE, IF 100 MG/KG OF CALCIUM IS ORDERED IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, THE SOFTWARE WILL CALCULATE THE DOSE TO BE 10.75 ML OF CALCIUM GLUCONATE SOLUTION PER KILOGRAM OF BODY WEIGHT.

THE COMPLAINT ISSUE ALLEGED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED BECAUSE THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR EVALUATION. THE PURPOSE OF THE SMARTMONITOR 2 FUNCTIONAL SELF-TEST IS TO CHECK THAT ALL THE FEATURES OF THE UNIT ARE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. A FUNCTIONAL SELF-TEST SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK OR ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVE BY THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL YOU SHOULD ALSO PERFORM THE TEST: AFTER A LEAD WIRE IS CHANGED. AFTER THE PATIENT CABLE IS CHANGED. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 (SM2) IS INTENDED FOR USE IN CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF HEART BEAT AND RESPIRATION OF INFANT PATIENTS IN A HOME, HOSPITAL, OR PORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. SM2 RECEIVES PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS VIA TRANSDUCERS ATTACHED TO THE PATIENT AND DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE MONITOR, OR FROM DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE AUXILIARY INPUTS OF THE MONITOR. PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS (PATIENT EVENTS) AND EQUIPMENT EVENT ARE RECORDED IN NONVOLATILE MEMORY FOR SUBSEQUENT REVIEW AND ANALYSIS BY A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. DURING MONITORING, WHEN THE PATIENT'S BREATHING EFFORT AND HEART ACTIVITY ARE NOT WITHIN THE SET BOUNDARIES, AND INDICATOR LIGHT COMES ON AND AN ALARM SOUNDS. PATIENT ALARM LIMITS ARE SET BY THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE THE SM2 IS DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT. BASED ON A COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT ALLEGATION, CHMV HAS DETERMINED THAT NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION ACTIVITY INTO THE REPORTED ISSUE IS POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, IF THE DEVICE IS RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT A MALFUNCTION OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS TOOK PLACE, A FOLLOW-UP, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REPORT WILL BE FILED.

931350	0	MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF THE ARCHITECT I2000/I2000SR SYSTEMS WASH BUFFER FLUIDICS PATHWAY CAN OCCUR DURING THE MFG OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE USE OF CONTAMINATED PARTS FROM VENDORS AND/OR STORAGE AND SHIPPING OF INSTRUMENTS UNDER FAVORABLE MICROBIAL CONDITIONS, OR MICORBIALLY CONTAMINATED ARCHITECT SYS AUTOMATED RECONSTRUCTION MODULE (ARM) TO PREPARE WASH BUFFER. THE CURRENT ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT IN THE WAS BUFFER IS UNABLE TO PREVENT GROWTH OF MICROORGANISMS TO HIGH LEVELS. ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE FOR THE WASH BUFFER FLUIDICS PATHWAY REDUCES THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION BUT DOES NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATE IT. CERTAIN MICROORGANISMS THAT CONTAMINATE THE WASH BUFFER (LINE DILUTENT) FLUIDICS PATHWAY ON THE ARCHITECT I2000/I2000SR SYS CAN PRODUCE FOLIC ACID, OR STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR METABOLITE. THIS MICROBIAL FOLIC ACID IS THEN ADDED TO THE REACTION MIXTURE, AS THE WASH BUFFER IS USED TO DILUTE BOTH SAMPLE AND CONJUGATE AND TO WASH THE MICROPARTICLES IN THE FOLATE ASSAY. IF CONTAMINATION INCREASES TO A HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL (APPROX >25,000 COLONY FORMING UNITS [CFU'S]), THE ARCHITECT FOLATE ASSAY PERFORMANCE CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE MICROBIALLY PRODUCED FOLIC ACID IN THE WASH BUFFER. AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED: ARCHITECT I2000/I2000SR SYSTEM ARE NOW FLUSHED WITH DEIONIZED WATER FOLLOWED BY AIR WITHIN 2 HRS OF COMPLETING FUNCTIONAL TESTING. ADDITIONALLY, THE INSTRUMENTS ARE STORED AND SHIPPED WITH AIR IN THE LINES. PREVIOUSLY MFG ARCHITECT I2000 INSTRUMENT MFG IN DALLAS WERE STORED AND SHIPPED WITH A WASH BUFFER FILTER INSTALLED. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOW STORED AND SHIPPED WITHOUT THE WASH BUFFER FILTER INSTALLED. UPON INSTRUMENT INSTALLATION, ABBOTT FIELD SVC NOW DECONTAMINATES THE ARCHITECT I2000 SYSTEM PER THE INTERNAL DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES AND INSTALLS A NEW WASH BUFFER FILTER. THE WASH BUFFER TRANSFER PUMP, WHICH IS REC'D DIRECTLY FROM THE VENDOR, WAS FOUND TO BE BACTERIALLY CONTAMINATED. THE VENDOR HAS CHANGED THE MFG PROCEDURE TO INCLUDE FLUSHING THE PUMP WITH ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL PRIOR TO SHIPMENT TO ABBOTT. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE ARCHITECT ARM MODULE RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE VENDOR, WAS BACTERIALLY CONTAMINATED. ABBOTT IS WORKING WITH THE VENDOR TO ADDRESS THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION ISSUE. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE INSTRUMENT DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE ARE IN PROCESS. THE IMPROVEMENTS WILL ENSURE THE DECONTAMINATION SOLUTION CONTACTS ALL PORTIONS OF THE BUFFER FLUIDICS PATHWAY. INTERNAL DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES WERE REVISED TO CORRECT THE FLUID LOADING ISSUES THAT COULD SOMETIMES PREVENT THE PROCEDURE FROM EXECUTING PROPERLY. SODIUM AZIDE AND/OR OTHER PRESERVATIVES WILL BE ADDED TO THE WASH BUFFER TO IMPROVE CONTROL OF MICROBIAL GROWTH. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. END OF REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT AFTER DECONTAMINATING THE ANALYZER, THE ARCHITECT FOLATE CONTROLS ARE FIRST ACCEPTABLE AND THEN AFTER A WEEK GO BACK TO BEING OUT OF RANGE HIGH.

3358266	1	CHILDREN'S MEDICAL VENTURES (CHMV) RECEIVED A REPORT FROM A DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME) ASSOCIATED WITH THE SMARTMONITOR 2 PS (PROFESSIONAL SERIES) DEVICE. THE REPORT STATED THAT THERE WAS A LONG DELAY BETWEEN PATIENT EVENT AND THE DEVICE ALARMING FOR THE PATIENT EVENT. THE SMARTMONITOR DEVICE WAS REPORTEDLY IN USE AT THE TIME OF THE REPORTED ISSUE. NO PATIENT HARM HAS BEEN REPORTED. THE DME WAS CONTACTED FOR A FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION. HOWEVER, THE DME WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE DATA DOWNLOAD OR THE PRESCRIBED SETTINGS OF THE DEVICE IN QUESTION BUT STATED THAT THE DELAY WAS LONGER THAN 5 SECONDS. (B)(4). THE COMPLAINT ISSUE ALLEGED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED BECAUSE THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR EVALUATION. THE DME STATED THAT IT COULD NOT CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE HAD BEEN SENT IN FOR EVALUATION. THE SMARTMONITOR2 PS AND SMARTMONITOR2 PSL ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN THE CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF RESPIRATION, HEART RATE, AND SPO2 LEVELS (SMARTMONITOR2 PS ONLY) OF INFANT, PEDIATRIC, AND ADULT PATIENTS. THE DEVICE DETECTS AND ALARMS FOR PERIODS OF HIGH OR LOW HEART RATE, HIGH OR LOW BREATH RATE, AND HIGH OR LOW SATURATION (SMARTMONITOR2 PS ONLY). WHEN USED AS AN INFANT MONITOR, IT IS INTENDED FOR USE IN A HOME OR HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. FOR INFANTS ONLY, IT MONITORS AND ALARMS FOR CENTRAL APNEAS. WHEN USED AS A PEDIATRIC OR ADULT MONITOR, IT IS INTENDED FOR USE IN A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. PATIENT ALARM LIMITS ARE SET BY THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL BEFORE THE SMARTMONITOR 2 PS IS DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT AND ARE TYPICALLY SET UP WITH PRESCRIBED SETTINGS WHICH INCLUDE A DELAY BEFORE RECORDING APNEAS AND A DELAY BEFORE ANNUNCIATING AN ALARM FOR AN APNEA CONDITION. THE USER OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR READING, UNDERSTANDING, AND FOLLOWING THE WARNING AND CAUTION STATEMENTS THROUGHOUT THIS MANUAL. BASED ON A COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT ALLEGATION, CHMV HAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THE DEVICE IN QUESTION DID NOT PERFORM TO SPECIFICATION; EFFECTIVELY NOTIFYING THE CAREGIVER OF A POTENTIAL EVENT. IT IS DETERMINED THAT NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE ALLEGED COMPLAINT ISSUE IS APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, IF THE DEVICE IS RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT A MALFUNCTION TOOK PLACE, A FOLLOW-UP, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REPORT WILL BE FILED.
1357078	1	THE INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THE CUSTOMER'S ALLEGATION. A SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS CAN LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE TREATMENTS OF A RETIRED PRESCRIPTION: USER PERFORMS ONLY THE IMAGE PORTION OF A TREATMENT, THEN RETIRES THE PLAN IN FAVOR OF AN EDITED PLAN. USER FAILS TO APPROVE THE NEW PLAN FOR TREATMENT. USER CALLS UP PT FOR TREATMENT AND RECEIVES MESSAGE 'ONE OR MORE PLANS ARE UNAPPROVED/PLANNING APPROVED FOR THIS PT. ONLY THE TREATMENT APPROVED PLANS WILL BE LOADED FOR TREATMENT' AND LOADS THE RETIRED PLAN (BY DESIGN - SINCE THIS PLAN HAS A PARTIALLY TREATED FRACTION, COMPLETING THAT FRACTION IS ALLOWED BY THE SYSTEM). USER TREATS THE RETIRED PLAN. DUE TO A MALFUNCTION WHERE THE PLAN IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR DOSE ACCUMULATION, THE SYSTEM FAILS TO SAVE THE TREATMENT RECORD AT THE END OF THE TREATMENT, AND PRESENTS TWO ERROR MESSAGES TO THE USER; 'WARNING: SAVE OF SESSION DATA AND/OR TREATMENT RECORD FAILED', FOLLOWED BY 'SESSION SAVE FAILED: SESSION DATA AND/OR TREATMENT RECORDS WILL NOT BE STORED ... AND WILL NEED TO BE IMPORTED FROM THE DICOM BACKUP LOCATION LATER' - THIS MESSAGE MUST BE SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED USER. USER FAILS TO IMPORT THE TREATMENT RECORD PRIOR TO THE NEXT TREATMENT SESSION, AND, SINCE THE RETIRED PLAN IS STILL PARTIALLY TREATED, REPEATS STEPS 3 TO 5. ALTHOUGH NO INJURY WAS REPORTED IN THIS CASE, THE CHANGE TO THE PLAN COULD BE A SHIFT IN POSITION OR FIELD SHAPE, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO A SERIOUS INJURY. VARIAN HAS ISSUED A CUSTOMER TECHNICAL BULLETIN TO DISCUSS ISSUES AROUND RETIRED PLANS AND WILL REFER THE MALFUNCTION HERE TO THE CAPA SYSTEM. NO FURTHER REPORT IS ANTICIPATED. >< THE PHYSICIST STATED THAT A PLAN WAS GENERATED ON (B) (6) 2008 AND WAS IMAGED. A REVISION WAS THEN MADE: HOWEVER, THE RETIRED PLAN WAS BROUGHT UP ON THE 4DITC AND TREATED ON BOTH (B) (6) 2008 AND (B) (6) 2008. HE NOTICED THAT THESE TREATMENTS WERE NOT SAVED BACK INTO HISTORY SO WENT IN TO DO A MANUAL TREATMENT AND THAT IS WHEN HE NOTICED THAT THE RETIRED PLAN HAD BEEN TREATED TWICE (AFTER IT HAD BEEN RETIRED). THERE WAS NO MISADMINISTRATION TO THE PT AS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RETIRED AND REVISED PLAN WAS A SETUP FIELD.
2702257	0	A VNS PROGRAMMING PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT HE PERFORMED A SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND WHEN HE DID THE PATIENT COMPLAINED THAT SHE FELT A HORRIBLE PAIN UP HER NECK AT THE LEAD SITE AND HAS CONTINUED TO FEEL THE SAME PAIN EVERY HOUR SINCE THAT TIME. THE PATIENT'S DEVICE HAD BEEN PROGRAMMED OFF PRIOR TO THE TESTING. THE TEST IS PERFORMED AT 1MA.  THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT PERFORM A FINAL INTERROGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT PATIENT WAS STILL TURNED OFF BEFORE SHE LEFT THE OFFICE. THE PATIENT WAS SO UPSET THAT SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO GET THE PROGRAMMING WAND NEAR HER. THE PATIENT RETURNED TO CLINIC AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEIR DEVICE HAD BEEN LEFT PROGRAMMED ON AND THEY WERE RECEIVING THERAPY AT 1MA ONCE AN HOUR. THE PATIENT WAS PROGRAMMED TO 1/20/500/30/60. THIS IS FROM A FAULTED SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC TEST. THE PATIENT'S DEVICE WAS SET TO 0 MA. TEACHING WAS PROVIDED AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT AND HOW TO PREVENT IN THE FUTURE. ANALYSIS OF SETTING PROVIDED BY SITE.
1624148	1	IT WAS REPORTED BY THE INITIAL CALLER THAT SOME PTS HAD TO BE REIMAGED (X-RAYED) DUE TO A SOFTWARE SYSTEM FAILURE. >< ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTER, PTS HAD TO BE RE-IMAGED (X-RAYED). THE DEVICE IN QUESTION WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY BY STRYKER PERSONNEL. ON (B) (6) 2010, (B) (6) FROM THE CLINIC CALLED AND STATED THAT MORNING USERS IN THE OPERATING ROOM WERE HAVING PROBLEMS PULLING UP IMAGES FROM THEIR (B) (6) SERVER. HE MENTIONED THAT THOSE IMAGES WERE AVAILABLE ON THE PRODUCTION SERVER, BUT THE IMAGES DID NOT SYNCHRONIZE OVER THEIR BACKUP SERVER. OPERATING ROOMS ARE CONNECTED TO THE BACKUP SERVER TO PULL IMAGES FROM WITHIN THE OR. DUE TO THIS ISSUE, THEY HAD TO RE X-RAY A COUPLE PTS THAT MORNING. THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED BY LOGGING INTO THE MAIN PRODUCTION SERVER REMOTELY WHICH REVEALED THAT THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE HAD STALLED WHICH HAD PREVENTED THE IMAGE DATA FROM REPLICATING ACROSS TO THE BACKUP SERVER. SINCE THE OR WAS POINTED TO THE BACKUP SERVER AND THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE HAD STALLED, THE USER WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE IMAGE DATA. ON 02/26/2010, FURTHER INVESTIGATION ON THIS CASE REVEALED THAT THE SITE HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST. IT APPEARS THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MISSING IMAGES ON THE BACKUP SERVER IS RELATED TO A MIDDLEWARE CONFIGURATION INTERFACE WHICH HAD BEEN SENDING ADD'L INFO TO THE POWER SERVER CONSTRAINING THE (B) (6) DATA BASE. THIS INFO IS NOT USED OR DISPLAYED BY OFFICEPACS AND IS NOT NEEDED FOR THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, THIS (B) (4) INFO, SUCH AS PT ADDRESSES HAD CONSTRAINED THE (B) (6) DATABASE TO THE POINT WHERE THE SYSTEM WAS FREEZING; THIS CAUSED THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE TO FAIL. AFTER CONFIGURING THE (B) (4) INTERFACE BY INSTALLING A FILTER TO PREVENT THE INFO THAT IS NOT NEEDED FROM GETTING STORED BY THE (B) (4) DATABASE, NORMAL SYSTEM OPERATION RESUMED AND THE SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE WORKING WELL. PT INFO WAS NOT LOST OR CORRUPTED, BUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE BACKUP SERVER UNTIL THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE WAS MANUALLY RESTARTED. THE USER REPORTED THAT THE PTS WERE REIMAGED ON (B) (6) 2010 BEFORE THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED. THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO AN (B) (4) CONSTRAINT CAUSED BY AN INCORRECT CONFIGURATION OF THE (B) (4) INTERFACE. THIS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN BEFORE. (B) (4) MESSAGES NEEDED TO BE FILTERED DUE TO THEIR LARGE VOLUME WHICH WERE NOT NEEDED OR USED BY OFFICEPACS POWER.
3180705	0	ON (B)(6) 2013 DURING REVIEW OF THE PATIENT多S PROGRAMMING HISTORY IT WAS OBSERVED THAT ON DATE OF IMPLANT, (B)(6) 2010, A FAULTED SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS TEST OCCURRED THAT CHANGED THE PATIENT多S SETTINGS. NO FINAL INTERROGATION WAS PERFORMED AND ALTHOUGH THE PATIENT WAS AT 0MA AND THEREFORE THERAPY AT THAT TIME WASN多T AFFECTED, THE OFF TIME HAD BEEN CHANGED TO 60MIN. ON THE PATIENT多S NEXT VISIT THIS WAS NOT NOTICED AND THEREFORE THE SETTINGS WERE ONLY PARTIALLY CORRECTED; THE OFF TIME WAS NOT CORRECTED UNTIL THE PATIENT多S FOLLOWING VISIT ON (B)(6) 2011. ANALYSIS OF PROGRAMMING HISTORY.
2432926	1	A CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT A SPRING THAT IS IN THE EQUIPMENT WAS BROKEN. THIS CAUSED THE RESULTS TO BE ALTERED FOR ONE PATIENT'S EXAM. THE EXAM WAS COMPLETED WITH THE SAME SYSTEM, AND THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO THE PATIENT. INVESTIGATION INCLUDING ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS IS IN PROGRESS.

1119287	1	a defect has been identified; a behavior in isite sing the conference presentation state (cps) - where the patient data on the canvas page are not synchronized with the image data in the viewer - incorrect data will be displayed - data from different patients. a conference presentation state is saved when grouping images to present in a conference to aid a diagnosis or to use as a training tool. it has been discovered that when multiple patients are selected, and any other than the first patient on the list is pulled up, both the patient that is pulled up and the first image in the list will display on the canvas page resulting in the initial patient on canvas page verses on the dx monitors are different patients. this behavior is present in both 4.1 and 3.6. if the presentation is saved as a system presentation (which is default) this mismatch of images may not be identified and could lead to possible mis diagnosis. >< device from reserve sample evaluated.
5294627	1	THE INITIAL MDR 2432235-2015-00580 WAS FILED ON DECEMBER 14, 2015. THE FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL MDR 2432235-2015-00580_S1 WAS FILED ON DECEMBER 30, 2015. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (01-06-2016): AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, SIEMENS DETERMINED THAT A USER ERROR CONTRIBUTED TO THE ISSUE. THE CUSTOMER WAS INCORRECTLY CONFIGURING THEIR SIDS. IN ADDITION TO ADJUSTING THE CONFIGURATION OF THE MISPL TO USE A SHORTER PURGE INTERVAL, THE CUSTOMER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE PROPER USE AND CONFIGURATION OF SIDS.><A SIEMENS CUSTOMER SERVICE ENGINEER (CSE) PERFORMED TROUBLESHOOTING REMOTELY. THE CSE DISCOVERED THAT THE ISSUE WAS A CONFIGURATION OF THE PURGE MISPL RULE. THE PURGE INTERVAL ALLOWED FOR A SAMPLE ID FROM (B)(6) 2015 TO BE RE-USED BEFORE THE OLD DATA WAS PURGED. THIS CAUSED THE WRONG PATIENT INFORMATION TO BE SENT TO THE DIMENSION VISTA INSTRUMENT. THE CSE DISCOVERED THAT THE SAMPLE IN QUESTION WAS NOT PURGED AS IT REMAINED IN A PENDING TO REVIEW" STATUS. THE ORDER ON THE DAY OF THE EVENT (B)(6) 2015 FOR THIS SAMPLE WAS REJECTED
5088649	0	THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED THAT THE SAMPLE TUBE DID NOT HAVE THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF REAGENT WHEN THE SAMPLE WAS PREP ON THE TQ PREP INSTRUMENT.  THE SAMPLE LINE HAD ASPIRATED AIR SINCE THE REAGENT BOTTLES WERE EMPTY. THERE WAS A FAILURE OF THE SENSORS. NO ERROR MESSAGE ALERTED THE CUSTOMER THAT THE REAGENT BOTTLES WERE EMPTY SINCE THE SENSORS HAD FAILED. THE FSE REPLACED BOTH REAGENT SENSORS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.(B)(4).><THE FSE (FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER) REPORTED THAT THE REAGENT SENSORS (REAGENT A AND REAGENT B SENSORS) IN A COULTER TQ-PREP WORKSTATION FAILED AND DID NOT GENERATE THE LOW REAGENTS MESSAGES. THE CUSTOMER PERFORMS THE DAILY INSTRUMENT CHECK AS PER INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND THE CUSTOMER VISUALLY CONFIRMS THE TUBES AFTER PREPARATION, WHICH ALERTED THE CUSTOMER TO THE ISSUE. ERRONEOUS RESULTS WERE NOT GENERATED AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE OR EFFECT TO PATIENT TREATMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EVENT.
4064790	1	SIEMENS HEALTHCARE DIAGNOSTICS HAS INVESTIGATED THIS ISSUE AND IDENTIFIED A TASK SCHEDULER ISSUE WITH THE CENTRALINK多 DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, SOFTWARE VERSION 14. THE ISSUE MAY CAUSE THE SOFTWARE TO STOP EXECUTING COMMANDS, INCLUDING UPLOADING VALIDATED RESULTS TO THE LIS. THE ISSUE IS RELATED TO AN INTERNAL SOFTWARE TIMER THAT OVERFLOWS AFTER 24 DAYS. AUTOMATED RULES TRIGGERED BY TASK SCHEDULERS OR BY ACTIONS IN THE CENTRALINK USER INTERFACE MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED.

1015496	0	INVESTIGATION SUMMARY; THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED DISCREPANT RESULTS FROM OPEN TO CLOSED MODE. THE INSTRUMENT IN USE WAS A CELL-DYN 3700SL. THE ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED THE DAY BEFORE WHEN PATENT CONTROLS WERE RUN (USED TO MONITOR CLOSED MODE). THERE WERE NO ERROR MESSAGES SEEN. THE CUSTOMER PERFORMED TROUBLESHOOTING WITHOUT RESOLUTION. THE CUSTOMER TECHNICAL ADVOCATE (CTA) VERIFIED THERE WERE NO OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE CLOSED MODE ASPIRATION PATHWAY. CALIBRATION WAS DONE IN OCTOBER 2007. CTA REQUESTED THAT THE CUSTOMER RE-CLEAN THE NEEDLE AND Y FITTING IN CLOSED MODE, CLEAN THE SHEAR VALVE AND THEN RUN PRECISION IN OPEN AND CLOSED MODES PRIOR TO CALIBRATING. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THE RECOMMENDED TROUBLESHOOTING HAD BEEN DONE BUT WHILE RUNNING THE PRECISION TESTING, FOUND THE RESULTS OUT OF SPEC. THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED THE BLOOD WAS NOT BEING CLEARED FROM THE TUBING PRIOR TO GOING TO THE WASTE CHAMBER. THE FIELD SERVICE REP (FSR) WAS DISPATCHED TO THE CUSTOMER SITE. THE FSR FOUND A STICKY SOLENOID VALVE (VALVE 3 ON THE VPM- VALVE PRESSURE MODULE). VALVE 3 CONTROLS THE P2 READING. THE FSR CLEANED THE TUBING FOR THE WASTE LINES THEN VERIFIED THE INSTRUMENT BY RUNNING CONTROLS. THE SYSTEM WAS PERFORMING WITHIN SPEC. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS REQUIRED. THE CD3700 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL (REV M): TROUBLESHOOTING CHARTS FOR ISSUES WITH IMPRECISE OR INACCURATE DATA GIVE INADEQUATE MIXING OR DRAINING OF THE MIXING CHAMBER, AS A RESULT OF A PROBLEM IN THE PRESSURE SYSTEM (E.G. LEAK OR OBSTRUCTION) AS A CAUSE OF IMPRECISION. (10-56 TO 10-60). TRENDING: A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT REPORTS, FOR THE PERIOD APRIL 2007 THROUGH DECEMBER 2007, DID NOT INDICATE ANY ADVERSE TREND FOR CELL- DYN 3700, LIST BASE 02H31-01 FOR THE COMPLAINT ISSUE. LABELING: THE EVENT IS ADDRESSED IN THE CELL-DYN 3700 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL, 06H89-01, REV F TROUBLESHOOTING: WOC DATA ARE IMPRECISE OR INACCURATE; 10-58. WIC DATA ARE IMPRECISE OR INACCURATE; 10-59. HGB DATA ARE IMPRECISE OR INACCURATE; 10-60. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE WAS EVALUATED BY VISUAL EXAMINATION AND PERFORMANCE TESTING. A COMPONENT/SUBASSEMBLY MALFUNCTION CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. THIS ISSUE WAS RESOLVED BY A SERVICE REP AND VERIFYING THE ANALYZER WAS PERFORMING TO SPECS. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. END OF REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT THE CELL-DYN 3700 SL ANALYZER HAS GENERATED DISCREPANT RESULTS WHEN COMPARING RESULTS OBTAINED IN OPEN VS CLOSED MODE OF OPERATION. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING DATA. OPEN MODE; WCB=4.1 K/UL, HGB=14.7 G/DL. CLOSED MODE; WBC=1.5 K/UL, HGB=5.6 G/DL. RESULTS WERE NOT RELEASED FROM THE LAB WITH NO ADVERSE IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED.

5328978	1	AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED TABLET AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS VERIFIED. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TABLET PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. THE TABLET PERFORMED ACCORDING TO FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS.><(B)(4).><IT WAS REPORTED THAT A MOTION TABLET FOR A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL WAS NOT TURNING ON. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE WAND BATTERY TEST WAS FINE. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED WITHOUT SOLVING THE ISSUE. BY SWITCHING THE TABLET ON, IT WAS LOCKED ON A BLANK SCREEN WITH A SMALL ARROW-CURSOR IN THE CENTRE, AND THE TABLET WAS UNRESPONSIVE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE TABLET HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY LEFT ON CHARGE. RETURN TO THE MANUFACTURER OF THE SUSPECTED TABLET IS EXPECTED BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE. REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING RECORDS CONFIRMED ALL TESTS PASSED FOR THE DEVICE PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION. NO NONCONFORMANCES WERE OBSERVED.><DESCRIBE EVENT OR PROBLEM; CORRECTED DATA: THE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED MDR INCORRECTLY INDICATED THAT THE REPORTED ALLEGATION ON THE SUSPECT DEVICE WAS VERIFIED.><THE SUSPECT  TABLET WAS RECEIVED BY THE MANUFACTURER.

IT WAS THEREFORE BELIEVED THAT THE ISSUE MAY BE WITH THE POWER CABLE AND A NEW POWER CABLE WAS SENT TO THE PHYSICIAN, BUT THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE WITH THE PROGRAMMING HANDHELD. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PROGRAMMING HANDHELD WOULD BE RETURNED FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HANDHELD MAY HAVE GOTTEN 多ZAPPED多.><THE HANDHELD AND FLASHCARD WERE RECEIVED FOR ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(4) 2015. DURING THE ANALYSIS IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE MAIN BATTERY WAS INSTALLED BACKWARDS. AS A RESULT, THE HANDHELD WAS UNABLE TO CHARGE THE MAIN BATTERY. ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE HANDHELD WOULD NOT POWER ON USING THE AC ADAPTER. THE CAUSE FOR THE ANOMALY IS ASSOCIATED WITH DAMAGED SYNC CONNECTOR LEADS TO THE PCB. BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE, THE HANDHELD WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE POWER FROM THE AC ADAPTER. THE CAUSE FOR THE DAMAGE TO THE CONNECTOR LEADS AND SOLDER CONNECTIONS IS MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH MISHANDLING OF THE DEVICE AS IT APPEARS THE CONNECTOR DETENTS ARE NOT BEING COMPRESSED WHEN REMOVING OR MANIPULATING THE SERIAL DATA CABLE, THUS PLACING AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF FORCE ON THE PCB AND ATTACHED CABLE RECEPTACLE. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED. ANALYSIS OF THE FLASHCARD WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(4) 2015. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS.

1214830	1	DURING AN INVESTIGATION OF AN INCIDENT REPORTED BY ONE OF INTELERAD'S FIELD PERSONNEL IN (B)(4), INTELERAD MEDICAL IDENTIFIED A SOFTWARE DEFECT IN THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES PREVENT CERTAIN IMAGES FROM BEING DISPLAYED WITH NO WARNING OR ALARM TO NOTIFY THE USER OF A FAILURE. WHEN RETRIEVING IMAGES USING THE DICOM SERVICE, AND WHEN THESE IMAGES ARE PROCESSED IN A BATCH, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTELEVIEWER DATABASE ON THE WORKSTATION MAY NOT BE UPDATED AND SOME IMAGES MAY NOT BE RETRIEVED. DEPENDING ON HOW THE IMAGES ARE LOADED, THIS MAY RESULT IN EITHER THE IMAGES NOT BEING SHOWN AT ALL (I.E. INTELEVIEWER REPORTING THAT THERE ARE FEWER IMAGES IN A SERIES THAN WERE SENT BY THE SERVER), OR A DELAY IN SHOWING THE IMAGES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE LOADED AGAIN. BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE POSSIBLE HEALTH HAZARDS WITH A LOCAL CUSTOMER, THERE WAS A CONCLUSION THAT SINCE THE PROBLEM COULD NOT ALWAYS BE DETECTED, THERE WAS A RISK OF A POSSIBLE MISDIAGNOSIS. THE INTELEVIEWER MODULE IS IN BOTH THE INTELEVIEWER WORKSTATION AND THE INTELEPACS PRODUCTS. ADDITIONAL BRAND NAME: INTELEVIEWER WORKSTATION. ADDITIONAL OTHER# V.3.5.2 PI TO P56. DEVICE MANUFACTURE DATE IS THE DATE THE INTELEVIEWER MODULE WAS RELEASED FOR INCORPORATION INTO THE INTELEPACS AND INTELEVIEWER WORKSTATION PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD. WE DO NOT "MANUFACTURE" SOFTWARE SINCE WE DEPLOY REMOTELY; THEREFORE, THE DATE OF THE SOFTWARE RELEASE TO THE CUSTOMER IS THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE. THERE WAS NO PATIENT EVENT IN THIS CASE AND NONE HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO DATE, HOWEVER, THE SOFTWARE ISSUE COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH IS WHY THIS MDR IS BEING SUBMITTED.

5792130	1	the customer's reported problem is currently under investigation by merge healthcare. for this reason, conclusions code (conclusion not yet available-evaluation in progress) was used. when more information becomes available, a supplemental report will be submitted.><merge hemodynamics monitors, measures, and records physiological data from a human patient undergoing a cardiac catheterization procedure. the system comprises the patient data module and the merge hemodynamics hemo monitor pc. the two units are connected via a serial interface. all vital parameters and evaluations are registered and calculated in the patient data module. this data is then transmitted to the merge hemodynamics hemo monitor pc via the serial interface. all data can be shown and monitored on the merge hemodynamics hemo monitor pc. on (b)(6) 2016, a customer reported to merge healthcare that the hemo monitor turned black. information obtained from the customer revealed that the problem occurred in the middle of a case and the hemo monitor was rebooted. it was further stated that the patient did not have to be moved to another lab to complete the procedure. with merge hemo not presenting physiological data during treatment, there is a potential for a delay in care that results in harm to the patient. however, the customer stated that the procedure was completed successfully once the hemo monitor was rebooted. (b)(4).

3828984	0	THE MANUFACTURER'S INVESTIGATION IS ON-GOING. ELEKTA WILL PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.><CHANNEL ARTEFACT SPREAD BY FILTERING TO RESEMBLE EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT ONE CHANNEL HAS LOW-AMPLITUDE (ORDER OF NEURONAL SOURCE) ARTEFACT OCCURING EVERY NOW AND THEN. TSSS PROCESSING USING MAXFILTER-2.2 DID NOT REMOVE THIS ARTEFACT, BUT SPREAD IT TO CLOSE-BY CHANNELS. ADDITIONAL TEMPORAL FILTER IN GRAPH (4-30 HZ) SMOOTHED THE TIME COURSE OF THE ARTEFACTS TO RESEMBLE EPILEPTIC INTER-ICTAL SPIKES. THE ARTEFACTS LOCALIZED TO THE FRONTAL CORTEX, TO THE LOCATION THAT WELL MATCHED WITH THE CLINICAL PROFILE OF THE PATIENT. OTHER EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY WAS NOT FOUND. WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE RAW DATA, THIS ARTEFACTUAL SOURCE COULD HAVE BEEN ASSUMED TO BE EPILEPTIC SOURCE. THE CASE DISPLAYS KNOWN BUT RARE BEHAVIOUR OF MAXFILTER PREPROCESSING: IF BAD CHANNEL IS NOT MARKED/DETECTED AND THE ARTEFACT IS LOW IN AMPLITUDE, SO THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO BE DETECTED BY THE TEMPORAL EXTENSION OF TSSS, THE SPATIAL FILTER (I.E. SSS) WILL SMOOTH THE ARTEFACT TO RESEMBLE REAL MAGNETIC FIELD. TYPICALLY THE ARTEFACT IS SUPPRESSED BY EITHER DETECTING THE CHANNEL AS BAD OR BY TERMPORAL PROJECTION (IN TSSS).><THE MANUFACTURER'S INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THAT BOTH AUTOMATIC BAD CHANNEL DETECTION AND THE TEMPORAL SSS (TSSS) FAILED TO RECOGNIZE SHORT-DURATION JUMPING ARTEFACTS ON A SINGLE MEG CHANNEL. THEREFORE, MAXFILTER TSSS PROCESSING CAUSED SPREADING OF SUCH SUDDEN JUMPS ON SINGLE CHANNEL AS ARTEFACTS TO SEVERAL MEG CHANNELS. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BAND-PASS FILTERED ARTIFACT RESEMBLED AN EPILEPTIC SPIKE. THE USER PERFORMED TYPICAL ANALYSIS OF LOCALIZATION OF EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY ON THE DATA. THE MEG RESULTS WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CLINICAL PICTURE OF THE PATIENT, AND NO OTHER (REAL) EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY WAS FOUND IN THE DATA. HOWEVER, USER SUSPECTED THE VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS BY USING NORMAL CLINICAL PRACTICES AND BY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS, E.G. LACK OF CORRESPONDING ACTIVITY IN THE EEG DATA MEASURED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH MEG DATA. USER CONSULTED ELEKTA PERSONNEL, AND THE ACTIVITY WAS CONFIRMED TO BE AN ARTIFACT BY REVIEWING THE RAW DATA TO WHICH MAXFILTER PROCESSING WAS APPLIED, AS DESCRIBED IN MAXFILTER USER MANUAL AND ACNS AND ACMEGS GUIDELINES. AFTER MANUALLY SELECTING THE ILL-BEHAVING CHANNEL, AND OMITTING IT FROM MAXFILTER PROCESSING, NO ARTIFACT REMAINED IN THE PROCESSED DATA. NO HARM WAS REALIZED TO THE PATIENT. EVEN IF THE ANALYSIS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE CLINICAL USER, THE RESULT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TYPICALLY USED ALONE FOR THE PRESURGICAL PLANNING, BUT ONLY IN AGREEMENT WITH OTHER IMAGING MODALITIES AND IN REFERRING PHYSICIAN'S CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THAT MAXFILTER DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEMATIC CHANNEL MEG1023 AS A BAD ONE, BECAUSE: 1. THE AUTOMATIC BAD CHANNEL SCANNING DID NOT FIND THE ARTIFACT DUE TO LARGE DISTURBANCES CREATED BY THE VNS DEVICE. 2. THE JUMPS HAVE SHORT DURATION (<100 MS) AND OCCURRED INFREQUENTLY. THEREFORE, TSSS-PROCESSING IN MAXFILTER DID NOT INCLUDE THE ARTIFACT SHAPE IN THE DISTURBANCE WAVEFORMS WHICH WERE PROJECTED OUT WHEN USING DEFAULT PARAMETER SETTINGS. THUS, MAXFILTER PROCESSING DID NOT REMOVE THE ARTIFACT. FIELD CORRECTIVE ACTION (FCO 145 036 01 113) WAS RELEASED TO CUSTOMERS JUNE 2014. USER NOTICE RELEASED TO CUSTOMERS CLARIFIES THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE, PROVIDING SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON HOW TO INSPECT THE OUTPUT DATA IN ORDER TO DETECT SIMILAR ARTIFACTS. THIS IS A VERY RARE COMBINATION OF INDIVIDUAL EVENTS THAT TOGETHER CAUSED THE ARTEFACT TO RESEMBLE POTENTIALLY PATHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. NO HARM OR RISK OF HARM WAS REALIZED TO THE PATIENT.

2431076	1	ISMP MEDICATION ERRORS REPORTING PROGRAM. IN OUR HOSPITAL WE HAVE TWO COMPUTER SYSTEMS WHERE ALLERGIES ARE LISTED. ONE IS USED FOR THE INPATIENT ADMISSIONS AND ONE IS USED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THERE IS AN INTERFACE ISSUE WITH THESE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND THEY DO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER. ALSO, WE CHANGED THE INPATIENT PHARMACY COMPUTER SYSTEM IN XXXXXXXXX 2010. WHEN A PATIENT IS ADMITTED NOW, IF THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY ADMITTED THE OLD SERIES COMPUTER SYSTEM, ALLERGY INFORMATION FLOWS INTO THE NEW (B)(6) PHARMACY COMPUTER SYSTEM AND (B)(6) CLINICAL (HOSPITAL WIDE SYSTEMS) AND ALLERGIES ARE UPDATED AND VERIFIED BY PHARMACISTS. HOWEVER, NEITHER OF THESE SYSTEMS COMMUNICATES (NOT INTERFACED) WITH THE ER SYSTEM. WE HAD A PATIENT ADMITTED TO OUR HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2010 WHO HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO AVELOX (MOXIFLOXACIN) DURING THIS ADMISSION. AT THAT TIME THE PATIENT'S ALLERGIES WERE UPDATED IN THE SERIES COMPUTER SYSTEM AND WERE ADDED TO THE PATIENT'S FACESHEET WHICH IS PRINTED WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT ADMISSION. THE PATIENT WAS BROUGHT TO THE ER ON (B)(6) 2011 (ABOUT 6 MONTHS LATER) AND AGAIN RECEIVED AVELOX DESPITE HAVING THE ALLERGY LISTED IN THE SERIES COMPUTER SYSTEM AND ON THE FACESHEET. THE PATIENT DID NOT HAVE ALLERGIES LISTED IN THE ER COMPUTER SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. THE PATIENT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE ER AGAIN ON (B)(6) 2011 (ABOUT A MONTH AFTER) AND AGAIN RECEIVED AVELOX. SHE HAD A THIRD ALLERGIC REACTION AND HAD TO BE TREATED AT THAT TIME FOR THIS REACTION. AGAIN THE PATIENT'S ALLERGIES WERE LISTED IN THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND ON THE FACE SHEET BUT NOT IN THE ER SYSTEM. OF NOTE, THE PATIENT WAS SEEN IN OUR ER 13 TIMES BETWEEN THE INITIAL ALLERGIC REACTION ON (B)(6) 2010 AND THE MOST RECENT EVENT ON (B)(6) 2011. OBVIOUSLY, THERE WERE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALLERGY INFORMATION TO BE RECONCILED IN THIS PATIENT THAT WAS MISSED. WE HAVE SINCE CHANGED OUR PROCESS, ER NURSES ARE NOW REQUIRED TO CHECK ALLERGIES IN BOTH THE ER SYSTEM AND THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM FOR ANY PATIENT WHO PRESENTS. WE THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE TO REPORT THIS BECAUSE WITH MANY HOSPITALS GOING TO MORE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THERE MAY BE ISSUES WITH PATIENT INFORMATION BEING COMMUNICATED BETWEEN THE SYSTEMS. IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE STAFF ON THESE ISSUES AND PUT IN PLACE POINTS OF CHECK (E.G. CHECKING THE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS WHERE INFORMATION MAY BE DOCUMENTED, INTERVIEWING THE PATIENT WITH EACH ADMISSION TO OBTAIN CURRENT ACCURATE MEDICAL INFORMATION, TELLING THE PATIENT THE NAMES OF THE MEDICATIONS YOU ARE ADMINISTERING, ETC) TO PREVENT THESE ERRORS FROM OCCURRING.

2424859	1	THE FOLLOWING IS A RECAP OF THE PROGRESS TO DATE REGARDING THE TELEMETRY DROP OUT ISSUE. BACKGROUND: WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING DROPOUT ON THE GE TELEMETRY PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM FOR SOME TIME. BASED ON THE CALLS WE RECEIVED, THE DROP OUT SEEMED INTERMITTENT AND RANDOM IN TERMS OF TIMING, DURATION AND EFFECTED FLOORS/UNITS. IN MOST CASES THE DURATION WAS BRIEF (< 10 MINUTES) AND TYPICALLY HAD RESOLVED ITSELF BY THE TIME BIOMED RESPONDED TO THE CALL. THESE INSTANCES WERE REPORTED TO GE AND IN SOME CASES GE CAME ON SITE TO INVESTIGATE BUT COULD FIND NO ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM. AFTER SEVERAL INSTANCES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2011, THE HOSPITAL BIOMED AND GE INCREASED THEIR EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE DROP OUT. IN THE CASE OF THE HOSPITAL BIOMED, THIS INVOLVED USE OF PROCURING SPECIAL EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE AND TRAINING ON THE EQUIPMENT. USING THIS EQUIPMENT, WE WERE ABLE TO DOCUMENT THAT THERE WAS A SOURCE OF INTERFERENCE IMPACTING THE L BAND FREQUENCIES IN WHICH THE TELEMETRY FLOOR SYSTEM OPERATES. THE CHALLENGE THEN WAS TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF INTERFERENCE. DUE TO THE SEEMINGLY RANDOM AND INTERMITTENT NATURE OF THE DROPOUT ISSUES THIS WAS AKIN TO THE NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK. THE HOSPITAL BIOMED INITIATED AN INTENSIVE SYSTEM MONITORING AND TESTING PROTOCOL INVESTIGATING VARIOUS POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INTERFERENCE (PORTABLE EQUIPMENT, TELEMETRY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, HVAC SYSTEMS, ETC). FINDINGS: VIA THE DAILY SYSTEM MONITORING, WE OBSERVED THAT THE INTERFERENCE WAS OCCURRING AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY UNDERSTOOD. THESE INSTANCES WERE VERY BRIEF AND OFTEN DID NOT IMPACT THE UNIT FREQUENCIES (L BAND) OR RESULT IN TELEMETRY DROPOUT. WE DETERMINED A METHOD FOR LOCATING THE SOURCE AND ULTIMATELY FOUND THAT IT WAS TELEMETRY BOXES (TRANSMITTERS) THEMSELVES THAT WERE THE SOURCE OF INTERFERENCE. SPECIFICALLY, IT SEEMED THAT A TELEMETRY BOX IN A LOW BATTERY STATE WAS THE SOURCE OF INTERFERENCE. WE HAVE CONFIRMED THIS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH GE AND RELAYING OUR FINDINGS. GE IS WORKING TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. THEY STATE THAT NO REPORTS OF THIS TYPE OF ISSUE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FROM OTHER SITES USING THE L BAND TELEMETRY SYSTEM. NEXT STEPS: 1) HOSPITAL BIOMED HAS OBTAINED LOANER TELEMETRY BOXES AND SENT TELEMETRY BOXES EXHIBITING THE ISSUE TO GE FOR ANALYSIS AND TESTING. 2) HOSPITAL BIOMED HAS IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING STEPS FOR CLINICAL STAFF TO MITIGATE THE TELEMETRY BOX LOW BATTERY STATE. IMPORTANT TELEMETRY BOX USE AND STORAGE INFO: DO NOT STORE THE TELEMETRY BOXES WITH THE BATTERIES INSIDE. USE NEW BATTERIES FOR EACH PATIENT. CHANGE BATTERIES AS SOON AS INDICATED BY TELEMETRY BOX LED OR CHANGE BATTERY ALARM AT THE CENTRAL/DECENTRAL STATION. 3) OUR CARDIOVASCULAR (CV) TEAM TECHNICIANS WILL BE CHECKING THE TELEMETRY BOX STORAGE DRAWERS DURING ROUNDS AND REMOVING BATTERIES FROM ANY STORED BOXES. 4) BIOMED PLANS TO REPORT THE ISSUE AND OUR FINDINGS TO THE APPROPRIATE BODIES (FDA-MAUDE, MEDSUN, ECRI).

UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A SEPARATE MDR REPORT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREATED FOR THE SECOND OPERATOR EVENT. REFER TO MANUFACTURER REPORT NUMBER 1628664-2015-00286 FOR ALL FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE SECOND OPERATOR. THE CUSTOMER PERFORMED A DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE USING 2% INSTEAD OF 0.5% SODIUM HYPOCHLORIDE (BLEACH) ON THE ARCHITECT I2000SR. THIS PROCEDURE IS SIMILAR TO THE INTERNAL DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE WHICH IS AN AS-NEEDED MAINTENANCE TO BE PERFORMED BY FIELD SERVICE USING 0.5% SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE. AFTER THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED, THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED LIQUID WASTE COMING OUT OF THE INSTRUMENT AND NOTICED THE OUTLET WASTE TUBING HAD BECOME DISCONNECTED FROM THE EXTERNAL WASTE PUMP. DURING THE DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE, THE OUTLET WASTE TUBING HAD BEEN REMOVED BY THE CUSTOMER FROM A NON-ABBOTT WASTE CONTAINER IN ORDER TO EMPTY THE CONTAINER. WHEN THE TUBING WAS PLACED BACK INTO THE CONTAINER, THE CUSTOMER DID NOT NOTICE THE END OF THE TUBING CONNECTED TO THE EXTERNAL WASTE PUMP HAD BECOME BENT CUTTING OFF FLOW. WHILE RUNNING THE INSTRUMENT, THE PRESSURE FROM THE FLOW OF LIQUID WASTE FROM THE EXTERNAL WASTE PUMP CAUSED THE TUBING TO BECOME DISCONNECTED, AND LIQUID WASTE LEAKED ONTO THE FLOOR. THE CUSTOMER ADJUSTED THE TUBING AND RECONNECTED TO THE WASTE PUMP. THE LABORATORY SPACE FOR THE ARCHITECT I2000SR WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING 4 METERS X 4 METERS AND NOT WELL VENTILATED. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL ADDRESSES LIQUID WASTE REQUIREMENTS AND THE HANDLING/DISPOSING OF WASTE, INCLUDING THE USE OF THE EXTERNAL WASTE PUMP WITH THE ARCHITECT I2000SR WHEN A FLOOR DRAIN IS UNAVAILABLE AND A SINK DRAIN IS USED; CHEMICAL HAZARD PRECAUTIONS WHEN USING SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE (BLEACH) AND OTHER DISINFECTANTS, INCLUDING THE USE OF PROPER FACILITY/EQUIPMENT/OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND THE USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) WHEN PERFORMING DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES; INSTRUCTIONS ON PERFORMING DAILY MAINTENANCE; INSTRUCTIONS WHEN OPERATING THE EXTERNAL WASTE PUMP; AND THE PRECAUTION THAT MAINTENANCE NOT SPECIFIC IN DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY ABBOTT LABORATORIES SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED ALONG WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO THE OPERATOR ON CONTACTING AREA CUSTOMER SUPPORT. A REVIEW OF THE ARCHITECT PRODUCT MONITORING FOUND NO SIMILAR ISSUES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS COMPLAINT. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS EVALUATION, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A MALFUNCTION OF THE EXTERNAL WASTE PUMP OR THE ARCHITECT I2000SR, AND NO DEFICIENCY OF THE PART OR THE ARCHITECT I2000SR WAS FOUND.

1781517	1	INSTANCE 1: ON (B)(6) 2010, A RADIOLOGIST WAS USING POWERSCRIBE TO DICTATE A SERIES OF REPORTS FOR A LIST OF PTS 'OPENED' IN ISITE WHEN THE WORKSTATION 'CRASHED' FOR UNK REASONS. SUCH CRASHES ARE NOT INFREQUENT. FOLLOWING REBOOTING OF THE WORKSTATION, ALL THE PTS WERE 'LOCKED' IN ISITE (AS IS TYPICAL FOLLOWING A CRASH) AND WERE THEN UNLOCKED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE RADIOLOGIST OPENED A PREVIOUSLY DICTATED PT AND DISCOVERED A MISMATCH: THE POWERSCRIBE REPORT TEXT AGREED WITH THE IMAGES AND THE IDENTIFIERS DISPLAYED IN ISITE BUT IT DID NOT AGREE WITH THE NAME DISPLAYED IN THE POWERSCRIBE PT NAME FIELD. THE POWERSCRIBE PT NAME FIELD INDICATED A DIFFERENT PT, ONE WHOSE DICTATION HAD BEEN PERFORMED EARLIER IN THE DAY. THE RADIOLOGIST LOGGED OUT OF POWERSCRIBE AND ISITE, LOGGED BACK IN TO BOTH, AND SAW THE THIS MISMATCH PERSISTED. THE WORKSTATION WAS THEN REBOOTED, THOUGH IT OTHERWISE APPEARED TO BE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY, AND THE MISMATCH WAS NO LONGER SEEN. INSTANCE 2: ON THE FOLLOWING DATE, A RADIOLOGIST DICTATED A REPORT WITH NO MORE THAN SIX PTS 'OPENED' IN ISITE. THIS WAS DONE ON A DIFFERENT WORKSTATION THAT IN INSTANCE 1, ABOVE. HE SAVED THE REPORT (USING THE 'SAVE' BUTTON), DID NOT SIGN THE REPORT, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED THE DICTATION UNDER A DIFFERENT PT'S NAME AS HE BEGAN TO REVIEW THIS DIFFERENT PT'S IMAGES. THE DIFFERENT PT SHOULD HAVE HAD NO DICTATION AT ALL. ADDITIONALLY, NO DICTATION WAS PRESENT UNDER THE PROPER PT'S NAME. THIS INSTANCE, UNLIKE THE FIRST, INVOLVED NO WORKSTATION CRASH OR REBOOTING. HAD THESE MISMATCHES OF PT'S NAMES NOT BEEN DETECTED BY THE RADIOLOGIST, WRONG-NAME REPORTS WOULD HAVE BEEN GENERATED. BECAUSE THESE INSTANCES REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL PT SAFETY ISSUES, BOTH POWERSCRIBE (DICTAPHONE) AND ISITE (PHILIPS) WERE NOTIFIED AND ENGAGED PROMPTLY. DATES OF USE: (B)(6) 2010. DIAGNOSIS OR REASON FOR USE: DICTATION. PACS SYSTEM IS PHILIPS ISITE VERSION (B)(4) DICTATION SOFTWARE IS NUANCE HEALTHCARE'S POWERSCRIBE V.

3515411	1	EVENT: THIS EVENT OCCURRED IN A (B)(6) HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2013 AND REPORTED TO US BY THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(4) 2013. A MEDICAL STAFF NOTICED THE PT ECG WAVEFORM ON THE CENTRAL MONITOR STATION, (B)(4), SCREEN TO BE A SQUARE WAVEFORM INDICATING THE PT BEING MONITORED ON A TELEMETRY TRANSMITTER MONITOR, LX-5230, WAS OFF-LINE, OUT OF RANGE, OR NOT CONNECTED. THE MEDICAL STAFF PERSON RUSHED INTO PT ROOM AND FOUND THE PT HAD EXPIRED. UPON EXAMINATION OF THE TELEMETRY TRANSMITTER MONITOR, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BATTERY POWER OF TELEMETER LX-5230 WAS EXHAUSTED. THIS EVENT WAS DUE TO USER ERROR AND NOT DUE TO ANY MALFUNCTION OF DEVICE, WHICH WAS ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE FACILITY. THE TELEMETRY TRANSMITTER MONITOR INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT IS THE FUKUDA DENSHI MODEL LX-5230 WHICH IS SOLD IN THE (B)(4) MARKET BUT WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE FUKUDA DENSHI TELEMETRY TRANSMITTER MONITOR LX-5630 WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD IN THE US MARKET. THIS EVENT OCCURRED SOLELY AS A RESULT OF USER ERROR AND NOT DUE TO ANY MALFUNCTION OF THE DEVICE. AND AS PER FUKUDA DENSHI CO. LTD. QA SYSTEM SOP, IS WAS DETERMINED TO BE A REPORTABLE EVENT AND THEREFORE AN FDA FORM 3500A WAS ORDERED TO BE FILED. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT, THE HOSPITAL STAFF WERE PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION AND THOROUGH EXPLANATION OF DEVICE OPERATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ROUTINELY CHECKING THE DEVICE POWER SOURCE AND MONITORING OF THE CENTRAL STATION.
4798113	0	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE TUBE MOUNT (CONNECTED TO THE LOWER TELESCOPIC TUBE, CARRYING THE X-RAY TUBE, COLLIMATOR AND ALPHA MOTOR DRIVE) FELL DOWN BY ITS OWN. NOBODY WAS HURT.><THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL ONGOING ON THIS EVENT. WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SENT TO THE FDA.><THE FOUR M8 FIXATION BOLTS OF THE TUBE MOUNT (CONNECTION TO THE LOWER TELESCOPIC TUBE, CARRYING THE X-RAY TUBE, COLLIMATOR AND ALPHA MOTOR DRIVE) WERE COMPLETELY LOOSE AND HAS CAME OFF OVER TIME RESULTED THAT THE TUBE ASSEMBLY FELL DOWN. INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE THIRD PARTY INSTALLATION TEAM DID NOT APPLY A THREAD LOCKER (LOCTITE) AND DID NOT APPLY THE REQUIRED TORQUE OF 26NM TO THE BOLTS, WHICH BOTH ARE CLEARLY DESCRIBED IN THE INSTALLATION MANUAL AND WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE CONFIRMED ON A CHECKLIST BY THE INSTALLER. EACH OF THOSE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE BOLTS FROM COMING LOOSE. THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEERS ADDED NEW M8 BOLTS, APPLIED LOCTITE 243 TO THE THREADS AND TIGHTENED THE BOLTS WITH A TORQUE OF 26NM ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION. ALL SYSTEMS INSTALLED BY THE SAME TEAM OF THIRD COMPANY WERE INSPECTED WITH NO FAILURE FOUND. (B)(4).
1551302	0	THE COMPLAINANT REPORTED THE ROTATOR BROKE AT PRESSURE LIMIT OF 500 PSI. >< DEVICE EVALUATION: THE SUSPECT DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THE DEVICE WAS EXAMINED VISUALLY AND THE COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED; THE ROTATOR WAS SEPARATED AT THE BOND BETWEEN THE COLLAR AND THE HOUSING. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD DID NOT REVEAL ANY EXCEPTION DOCUMENTS. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION IS ATTRIBUTED TO FAILURE OF THE ADHESIVE BOND BETWEEN THE ROTATOR HOUSING AND THE ROTATOR COLLAR. POTENTIAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE BEING EVALUATED. COMPLAINT DATA WILL BE MONITORED TO VERIFY EFFECTIVENESS OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD WAS REVIEWED.
2748980	0	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. SIGNALS IN THE RDF INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PLASMA LINE MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OCCLUDED DURING A PORTION OF THE RUN. THE OCCLUSION OF THE PLASMA LINE CAUSES THE PLASMA LINE TO NO LONGER CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLATELET PUMP DURING THE PCA SUBSTATE, WHICH IN TURN CAUSES THE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTEM EXPECTS. THIS CAN CAUSE WBCS TO ESCAPE THE LEUKOREDUCTION SYSTEM CHAMBER AND END UP IN THE PRODUCT BAG. THE ORIENTATION OF THE TUBING AS LOADED IN THE CENTRIFUGE HEX HOLDER UNDER CERTAIN FLOW CONDITIONS, MAY CAUSE THE PLASMA LINE TO PINCH OFF. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.><(B)(4). THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS (DHR) WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS EVENT. THERE WERE NO EVENTS NOTED IN THE DHR THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. ROOT CAUSE: THIS DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE REMAINS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES WERE PROVIDED IN THE INITIAL REPORT FOR THIS EVENT. ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE NEXT VERSION OF SOFTWARE FOR THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. THESE ALGORITHMS RECOGNIZE A POTENTIAL ELEVATED WBC COUNT DUE TO THE FAILURE MODE WITNESSED DURING THIS INVESTIGATION. THE SOFTWARE WILL FLAG THE PROCEDURE TO MEASURE OR "VERIFY WBC'S IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT". THE NEW ALGORITHMS ARE ADDED IN THE 6.1.2 TRIMA EQUIPMENT SOFTWARE UPGRADE. INTERNAL CAPAS HAVE BEEN INITIATED TO EVALUATE REPORTS OF ELEVATED WBC COUNTS.

BOTTLE 5 (ETHANOL) WAS THEN USED FOR THE FINAL DEHYDRATION STEP OF THE TWO (2) PROTOCOLS FROM WHICH SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING WAS REPORTED. THE MINIMUM FINAL REAGENT CONCENTRATION REQUIRED FOR ETHANOL IS 98%. THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING ETHANOL AT A CONCENTRATION LESS THAN THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR THE FINAL DEHYDRATION STEP IN A PROTOCOL IS RE-INTRODUCTION OF WATER INTO THE TISSUE WHICH CANNOT BE DISPLACED IN SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING STEPS; AND CONTAMINATION OF REAGENTS USED IN SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING STEPS ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN SUB-OPTIMAL PROCESSING. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING REPORTED WAS A USER ERROR, WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE REPLACEMENT OF ETHANOL IN BOTTLE 5 AND COMPLETED PRIOR TO COMMENCEMENT OF THE TWO PROTOCOLS FROM WHICH SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING WAS REPORTED.><LEICA BIOSYSTEMS RECEIVED A COMPLAINT REGARDING SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING FROM TWO (2) PROCESSING RUNS.

NO EXPOSURE OR INJURIES WERE REPORTED. NO IMPACT TO USER SAFETY OR PATIENT RESULTS WAS REPORTED. THE CUSTOMER ORDERED A REPLACEMENT FOR THE WASTE LINE ASSEMBLY PER FA30NOV2009 LETTER SINCE THE WASTE LINE ASSEMBLY (THEY HAVE) HAS BEEN ON SINCE INSTALLATION. >< (B)(4). EVALUATION RESULTS: PRODUCT MEETS RELIABILITY DATA. ABBOTT LABORATORIES RECEIVED AN INITIAL CUSTOMER COMPLAINT ALLEGING THE CELL-DYN INSTRUMENT DID NOT SIGNAL A WASTE FULL ALARM. ALTHOUGH THE ORIGINAL PART FOR THIS EVENT COULD NOT BE INVESTIGATED, THE INVESTIGATION OF THE REPORTED ISSUE DETERMINED THAT THE PART WAS IN USE GREATER THAN 2 YEARS. THE INVESTIGATION INTO RETURNED PARTS FROM THE FIELD SHOWED THAT ALL HAVE BEEN IN USE GREATER THAN 2 YEARS. IN-HOUSE INVESTIGATION OF THE RETURNED PARTS COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INITIAL COMPLAINT. THERE EXISTS A POTENTIAL FOR THE WASTE CONTAINER TO OVERFLOW WITH LIQUID WASTE WHEN THE WASTE SENSOR FAILS AT THE END OF ITS LIFE CYCLE. BASED ON THE INTENDED USE, THIS PART WILL WEAR OUT AND NEED PERIODIC REPLACEMENT AS IT IS IN CONTACT WITH BIOHAZARD MATERIAL AND CUSTOMER USAGE/HANDLING. IT CAN BE USED ON MULTIPLE CELL-DYN INSTRUMENT MODELS. NO PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE WAS IN PLACE. A REVIEW OF THE CELL-DYN SYSTEM OPERATORS MANUALS SHOWED ADEQUATE COVERAGE OF BIOHAZARD EXPOSURE AND WASTE OVERFLOW AS WELL AS TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION FOR POTENTIAL CAUSES. THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY IS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED. THE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY ISSUES WERE DETERMINED TO BE WITHIN ESTABLISHED FREQUENCY. A HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT (HHA) DETERMINED A LOW HEALTH RISK, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RISK MANAGEMENT FILE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCT ALTHOUGH, THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY MEETS THE RELIABILITY REQUIREMENT, THERE EXISTS A POTENTIAL FOR THE WASTE CONTAINER TO OVERFLOW WITH LIQUID WASTE IF THE PRODUCT FAILS AT THE END OF ITS LIFE EXPECTANCY. THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY PART LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 2 YEARS IS NOT CURRENTLY IN OUR PRODUCT LABELING. THE PREVENTIVE ACTION WILL INVOLVE A LABEL CHANGE FOR THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY. WE ARE CHANGING OUR LABELING TO HAVE A PART REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE OF 6 MONTHS, SO PARTS ARE REPLACED PRIOR TO THE END OF THE 2-YEAR LIFE FAILURE. THIS WILL HELP PREVENT OVERFLOW ISSUES CAUSED BY END OF LIFE PART FAILURE. A TAG THAT CAN BE AFFIXED TO THESE ITEMS WAS SENT WITH CUSTOMER LETTER. THIS TAG INCLUDES FIELDS TO RECORD INSTALLATION AND REPLACEMENT DATES. TAGS WILL ALSO BE INTRODUCED INTO REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLIES. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.

RISK MANAGEMENT SPOKE WITH A PHILIPS CUSTOMER SERVICE REP WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN CONTACTED BY OUR FACILITY BIOMEDICAL DEPT ABOUT IT, AND THE MONITOR WAS SENT TO THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE FOR ANALYSIS AND FOR A REPORT TO BE PROVIDED. A PHILIPS FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) CAME ON-SITE TO THE FACILITY TO DOWNLOAD THE MONITOR EQUIPMENT'S HISTORY FOR EVALUATION AND COMPLETE A PERFORMANCE TESTING ON THE DEVICE. TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EVENT, A PHILIPS HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS/PT MONITORING QUALITY & REGULATORY SPECIALIST PROVIDED A REPORT SPECIFYING THAT ON THE DATE OF THE REPORT, A NEWLY ADMITTED PATIENT HAD AN ALARM OCCUR AND STAFF NOTED AN ALARM STRIP WITH A SIMILAR RHYTHM WAS IN THIS NEW PATIENT'S ALARM HISTORY, BUT THE STRIP HAD AN EARLIER DATE ON IT WHICH WAS PRIOR TO THE ADMISSION DATE OF THE SECOND PATIENT. THE REPORT SAID THEY HAD INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE AND DETERMINED THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO CONFIRM THAT ANY DEVICE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED. THE FSE VERIFIED THE DEVICE WAS PERFORMING ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS AND WAS ALARMING AND STORING/RECORDING ALARM STRIPS APPROPRIATELY. THE FSE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED LOG FILES, BUT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS COULD NOT BE PERFORMED DUE TO THE PRIOR PATIENT'S ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE HAD NOT BEEN PROVIDED. THE LOGS DID SHOW THE LAST DISCHARGE/REMOVE DATA ACTION PERFORMED FOR A PATIENT PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT @ 16:22. IN SOME CASES, A PATIENT MAY BE DISCHARGED FROM THE CENTRAL, BUT MAY REMAIN ON THEIR MONITORING DEVICE FOR SHORT TIME AND MAY CONTINUE TO GENERATE ALARMS WHICH WILL THEN BE STORED FOR THAT BED. IF ANOTHER DISCHARGE IS NOT PERFORMED BEFORE A NEW PATIENT IS ADMITTED, THIS PRIOR ALARM DATA WILL BE APPENDED TO ANY NEW PATIENT ADMITTED TO THE BED. PHILIPS INDICATED INFORMATION ABOUT ADMITTING/DISCHARGING COULD BE FOUND IN THE INTELLIVUE INFORMATION CENTER INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE, PART # M3150-9001J, IN THE SECTION ON PATIENT MANAGEMENT. PHILIPS HC INDICATED THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND MONITOR INTERNAL QUALITY RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVOLVED PRODUCT AND WOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS AS NECESSARY.

3090390	0	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED AN ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE DOUBLE PLATELET PRODUCT AT THEIR (B)(6) SITE. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. INVESTIGATION: THE CUSTOMER DID NOT PROVIDE THE LOT NUMBER PERTAINING TO THIS EVENT,THEREFORE A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) SEARCH COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED FOR THIS SPECIFIC INCIDENT. ALL LOTS MUST MEET ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA BEFORE RELEASE. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED ELEVATED WBC DATA FOR MULTIPLE PROCEDURES. THE DATA FOR THESE PROCEDURAL EVENTS WAS ANALYZED AS A GROUPING. INVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE RUN DATA FILES (RDFS)IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PROCEDURAL EVENTS, AS LISTED BELOW, THAT MAY HAVE LED TO ELEVATED WBC LEVELS IN COLLECTED PRODUCT. ROOT CAUSE: RDFS FOR THE PROCEDURES WITH HIGH RWBC WERE RECEIVED, INVESTIGATED AND ANALYZED. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVENTS THAT LED TO ELEVATED WBC CONTENT IN PLATELET PRODUCTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND ARE AS FOLLOWS: PRE-PURGE SATURATIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT THE LRS CHAMBER HAS REACHED ITS WBC HOLDING CAPACITY BEFORE EXPECTED BY THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. POST-PURGE SATURATIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT AFTER AN LRS PURGE, THE LRS CHAMBER HAS RE-FILLED WITH WBCS BEFORE EXPECTED BY THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. PLASMA LINE OCCLUSIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT THE PLASMA LINE WAS PARTIALLY OCCLUDED DURING A PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE. THIS CAN CAUSE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, DECREASING THE HOLDING CAPACITY OF THE LRS CHAMBER. OTHER EVENTS - THESE CAN INCLUDE; CENTRIFUGE STOPS, MULTIPLE ACCESS ALARMS & FLOW ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A NON STEADY STATE CHAMBER CONDITIONS, AND RBC SPILLOVER SWITCH CAN POSSIBLY LEAD TO A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT. ALSO INCLUDED ARE DONOR RELATED CHARACTERISTICS. CORRECTION: A TRIMA SOFTWARE VERSION UPGRADE HAS BEEN COMPLETED AT ALL OF THE CUSTOMER多S CENTERS. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED DATA GATHERED FROM A TERUMO BCT RECOMMENDED TRIAL OF AVERAGING THE LAST 3 PLATELET COUNTS OF DONORS. THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT USING THE AVERAGE PLATELET COUNT SHOWED A MORE CONSISTENT PROCESS, WHICH WILL REDUCE VARIATION SHOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS RWBC FAILURES.><INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS.  A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.

5813537	1	the customer reported that on (b)(6) 2016 at 10:56:08a. the patient in room ((b)(6)) ecg hr dropped and rhythm showed asystole event but the monitor did not trigger the asystole alarm event until 10:58:18a. the caregiver claims mp70 asystole alarm was delayed up to 2 minutes after event. the patient had to have chest compression as a result of the event but expired.><the complaint is considered as user related and not a malfunction of the device. logs were sent for review and show that the alarms were paused for 3 minutes at 10:55:08. at 10:58:13 the logs show that the device provided an asystole alarm at 10:58:13 as configured instead of the expected time of 10:56. the device is designed to have the ability to configure pause alarms at intervals of one minute, two minutes, three minutes, or infinitely. device labeling adequately describes alarm behavior when alarms are paused noting that the monitor displays the message alarms paused and the red alarms paused lamp on the monitor front panel is lit.                                                              
2387857	1	IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING PATIENT USE THE CARESCAPE B850 PATIENT MONITOR EMITTED AN UNUSUAL CONSTANT BEEP-BEEP TONE THAT DID NOT AUDIBLY CORRESPOND TO AN EXPECTED ALARM TONE OR OTHER RECOGNIZABLE TONE, AND DID NOT CORRELATE TO ANY VISUAL PATIENT CONDITION. AS LONG AS THIS TONE IS SOUNDING NO OTHER DISCERNIBLE AUDIBLE ALARMS WILL BE ANNOUNCED. VISUAL ALARMS WERE NOT AFFECTED. THERE WAS NO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT, NOR AN INDICATION THAT INTERVENTION WAS PROVIDED. GE HEALTHCARE'S INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT A SOFTWARE ISSUE EXISTS IN WHICH A SOUND RESOURCE IS RE-USED, RESULTING IN THE REPORTED "BEEP-BEEP" TONE TO BE REPLAYED. THE ISSUE WILL ONLY OCCUR WHEN ALARM TONES ARE CHANGED FROM DEFAULT IEC TONES (AS DEFINED IN (B)(4)) TO LEGACY TONES (GE DEFINED TONES) AND REMOTE ALARM TONE IS CHANGED FROM LOCAL (SAME TONE AS USED IN LOCAL MONITOR) TO REPEAT (REMOTE ALARM IS REPEATED WITH ITS OWN TONE) IN THE DEFAULT SETUP MENU. IN ADDITION, ONLY WHEN A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE OF REAL PATIENT ALARMS OCCURS SIMULTANEOUSLY, BOTH WITH THE LOCAL PATIENT OR A REMOTE PATIENT MONITORED VIA THIS MONITOR, WILL THE ISSUE OCCUR. IN THIS SCENARIO, THE REPORTED "BEEP-BEEP" TONE WILL CONTINUE WITH NO CORRESPONDENCE TO THE ACTUAL PATIENT ALARM MESSAGES ON THE DISPLAY. HOWEVER, THE REAL PATIENT ALARM MESSAGES, EXISTING AND NEW, WILL BE DISPLAYED NORMALLY ON THE MONITOR. THE ALARM LIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE DISPLAY WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM AS DESCRIBED IN THE OPERATIONS MANUAL. THE ALARM SOUND SEQUENCES OF THE POSSIBLE NEW ALARMS WILL NOT ACTIVATE AUDIBLY AT THE MONITOR, BUT ALARMS ARE TRANSFERRED NORMALLY TO THE NETWORKED CENTRAL STATION. THE MONITOR MUST BE REBOOTED IN ORDER TO RESTORE PROPER AUDIBLE ALARM FUNCTION. GE HEALTHCARE HAS CORRECTED THIS ISSUE IN THE NEXT REVISION OF SOFTWARE, WHICH IS BEING APPLIED TO FORWARD PRODUCTION. NO PATIENT OR USER HARM HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR THIS ISSUE. NO SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK TO PATIENT OR USER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE ISSUE AS CHARACTERIZED. WARNINGS EXIST IN THE USER'S MANUAL REGARDING POSSIBLE EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS. THE CARESCAPE MONITOR B850 USER'S MANUAL STATES: "EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS, NETWORK OR NURSE CALL DISCONNECTION, AND ALARM VOLUME SETTINGS MAY RESULT IN MISSED ALARMS. ALWAYS KEEP THE PATIENT UNDER CLOSE SURVEILLANCE." IN ADDITION, THE MANUAL STATES, "IF AN ERROR MESSAGE APPEARS DURING OPERATION, IT IS THE LICENSED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE WHETHER THE UNIT IS STILL SUITABLE FOR PATIENT MONITORING. AS A GENERAL RULE, MONITORING SHOULD ONLY CONTINUE IN EXTREMELY URGENT CASES AND UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER. THE UNIT MUST BE REPAIRED BEFORE BEING USED AGAIN ON A PATIENT. IF AN ERROR MESSAGE APPEARS AFTER POWER-UP, THE UNIT MUST BE REPAIRED BEFORE BEING USED ON A PATIENT."
5688302	0	i was required to take a pre-employment drug screen, a non-dot 9 panel screen via (b)(6). the results came back with a positive indication of marijuana use despite no use by me. four days before the test, i oral surgery and was prescribed oxycodone for pain relief which i took many in the interval between the surgery and the pre-employment test. no indication for opiates was returned despite my heavy consumption of oxycodone due to pain, the last dose the evening before the test. when i asked the tester when they called, why there was no indication for opiates due to my substantial oxycodone use, the answer was we don't test for that". amazing - a non-dot 9 panel test requires opiate testing! since i am not a marijuana user and this test which should have indicated opiates  the test is totally inconsistent and should be retested as either chain of custody was violated  the sample was contaminated  or the device or process used to do drug testing is flawed. i previously worked for an (b)(6) company ((b)(6)) where i developed software for a blood-gas analyzer - a device and process very similar to urine drug testing. control solutions are used to calibrate the device for correct operation as well as periodically verify that the device is working properly. the only recourse the testing company ((b)(6)) provides is to retest the sample which is pointless if any of these conditions are true. the fda requires accuracy and repeatability of measurements so i have no doubt that a flawed process will yield the same flawed results. i had my oral surgery at (b)(6) on the (b)(6) 2016 and when i checked with my oral surgeon he said he surprised if there was not a positive indication for opiates  as such my urine sample was a control solution for opiates which the device failed to detect - how can there be any confidence in any measurement taken? it should have been detected for 4-6 days after use. this area of drug screen testing is sorely in need of government regulations to protect the employment applicant. as it stands now  we have no rights against false testimony like this. at least a retest a few days later would be a start. as i said we have no rights against false testimony like this. please  start regulating these drug screening  so this does not happen to anyone else. i lost a (b)(6) job because of this!"

THE BWI ENGINEER ARRIVED ON SITE FOR TROUBLESHOOTING AND IT WAS POSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE THE NOISE AND ERROR 8. BY CHANGING THE BACKPLANE, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THE NOISE ISSUE BUT AFTER ABOUT 20 MIN ERROR 8 APPEARED AGAIN. THE ENGINEER REPLACED THE ECG BOARDS AND PERFORMED THE FULL SYSTEM TEST WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ISSUE. AFTER THIS, THE SYSTEM WAS FOUND OPERATIONAL. THE REPLACED PARTS WERE SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE ISSUE WAS CAUSED BY THE FAULTY BACKPLANE CARD. DIODE TVS D1000 WAS FOUND FAILED AT ISOLATION TEST. THE ECG CARDS WERE FOUND OPERATIONAL. THE DHR ASSOCIATED WITH CARTO 3 # R10063 WAS REVIEWED AND THERE WERE NOT ANY DISCREPANCIES NOTED.

1406002	0	ASPECT REPRESENTATIVE WAS INFORMED ON (B)(6), 2009 BY AN ATTENDING ANESTHESIOLOGIST OF A CASE OF APPARENT INTRAOPERATIVE AWARENESS. THE AWARENESS CASE HAD BEEN REPORTED TO THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST BY A RESIDENT PHYSICIAN, AND HAD OCCURRED ON (B)(6), 2009. THE CASE INVOLVED A NINE YEAR-OLD CHILD WHO COMPLAINED OF BEING AWAKE, FEELING INITIAL SKIN INCISION AND DEVICE IMPLANTATION DURING A COCHLEAR IMPLANT PROCEDURE. FOLLOWING THE CASE, THE CHILD EXPERIENCED BAD DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES; THEREFORE, WAS REFERRED TO AND TREATED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST. ACCORDING TO THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST, THE CHILD IS CURRENTLY DOING VERY WELL. THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST PROVIDED A COPY OF THE AUTOMATED ANESTHESIA RECORD (WHICH INCLUDED BIS VALUES) ANNOTATED WITH THE TIME PERIODS OF REPORTED AWARENESS. THE ELECTRONIC BIS MONITOR TREND WAS ALSO REVIEWED. THE ANESTHESIA MANAGEMENT INCLUDED INHALATION INDUCTION WITH SEVOFLURANE, FOLLOWED BY ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION, AND MAINTENANCE WITH PROPOFOL AND REMIFENTANIL. INTRAOPERATIVE DRUG DOSING AND HEMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS WERE UNREMARKABLE AROUND THE TIME PERIODS OF AWARENESS. SIMILARLY, THE AVERAGE BIS VALUE WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 AROUND THESE TIME PERIODS. USE OF BIS MONITORING TO HELP GUIDE ANESTHETIC ADMINISTRATION MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCTION OF INCIDENCE OF AWARENESS WITH RECALL IN ADULTS DURING GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND SEDATION. DEVICE LABELING STATES CLINICAL JUDGMENT SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED WHEN INTERPRETING THE BIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER AVAILABLE CLINICAL SIGNS. RELIANCE ON THE BIS ALONE FOR INTRAOPERATIVE ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT IS NOT RECOMMENDED. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO DISCREPANCY IN THE INFORMATION PROVIDED FROM THE BIS MONITOR WITH THE OTHER AVAILABLE CLINICAL SIGNS AND ANESTHESIA MANAGEMENT. DEVICE FUNCTIONED AS INTENDED AND DID NOT MALFUNCTION. BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION, WE HAVE CONCLUDED BIS MONITORING DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH, AND DID NOT MALFUNCTION. OUR INVESTIGATION CONCLUDES THAT THIS INCIDENT DID NOT RESULT IN PERMANENT DAMAGE TO A BODY STRUCTURE OR PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF A BODY FUNCTION, DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH, AND DID NOT MALFUNCTION. HOWEVER, THIS PATIENT WHOSE ANESTHESIA CARE INCLUDED BIS MONITORING REQUIRED TREATMENT BY A PSYCHOLOGIST, CONSIDERED TO BE A MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO PRECLUDE SERIOUS INJURY. THEREFORE, AN MDR IS REQUIRED.

2057711	1	AN ERROR OCCURRED IN THE (B)(4) SOFTWARE AFTER A PT BECAME HYPOGLYCEMIC. THE SOFTWARE ERROR CAUSED AN ERROR NOTIFICATION TO BE DISPLAYED TO THE USER, AND PREVENTED THE USER FROM CONTINUING TO MANAGE THE PT ON THE SYSTEM. THE USER, FOLLOWING HER TRAINING, CONTINUED MANAGING THE PT MANUALLY (OFF THE SYSTEM). AT NO TIME DID THE SYSTEM ISSUE AN INCORRECT RECOMMENDATION. THE ERROR CONDITION WAS CORRECTED BY A COMPANY TECHNICIAN AND THE NURSE WAS THEN ABLE TO CONTINUE MANAGING THE PT ON THE SYSTEM. A CAPA WAS OPENED TO FULLY ANALYZE AND CORRECT THE CONDITION THAT LED TO THE ERROR. ALTHOUGH THE FAULT WAS CLEARLY EVIDENT TO THE USER, THIS ERROR OCCURRED WHEN THE PT BECAME HYPOGLYCEMIC AND THE SOFTWARE WAS CLASSIFIED AS A MAJOR LEVEL OF CONCERN ON THE 510(K). FOR THIS REASON, IT WAS DECIDED THAT AN MDR SHOULD BE FILED WITHIN 30 DAYS. AT APPROX 12:45 PM ON (B)(6) 2011, (B)(6), REC'D A NOTIFICATION ON HIS CELL PHONE OF A GLUCOCARE APPLICATION ERROR THAT HAD OCCURRED AT 12:17 PM AT (B)(6). PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF THE ERROR INFORMATION SENT IN THE NOTIFICATION REVEALED THAT THE ERROR WAS AN ASSERTION ERROR IN THE LOGIC OF THE (B)(6) PROTOCOL; THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH AN ERROR CAUSES THE DISPLAY OF AN ERROR SCREEN TO THE NURSE USING THE SYSTEM. (B)(6) THEN CONNECTED TO THE (B)(6) SYSTEM TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE ERROR CONDITION AND DETERMINE THE PT INVOLVED PRIOR TO CALLING THE UNIT. IT WAS NOTICED THAT A PT IN THE (B)(6) HAD HAD A GLUCOSE READING OF 69 MG/DL ENTERED AT 12:17 PM AND WAS ALERTING THE NURSE TO STOP THE INSULIN DRIP. (B)(6) PHONE THE UNIT AND ASKED FOR THE NURSE WHO WAS CARING FOR THE PT (B)(6). (B)(6) CONFIRMED SHE HAD GOTTEN AN ERROR, AND THAT SHE HAD STOPPED THE INSULIN DRIP BUT WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM THE INSULIN DRIP CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM DUE TO THE ERROR. (B)(6) CONFIRMED (B)(6) WAS MANAGING THE PT MANUALLY AND ASKED IF SHE HAD TAKEN A SUBSEQUENT GLUCOSE READING; (B)(6) CONFIRMED SHE HAD OBTAINED A READING OF 96 MG/DL AT 1 PM. (B)(6) INFORMED (B)(6) THAT THE PROTOCOL SHOULD BE STOPPED AND THEN RESTARTED IN THE SYSTEM USING THE MID-PROTOCOL START FUNCTION WITH A CURRENT AND PRIOR GLUCOSE LEVEL. (B)(6) ASKED (B)(6) TO OBTAIN A CURRENT GLUCOSE READING. (B)(6) DID SO AND REPORTED THAT THE BLOOD GLUCOSE WAS NOT 115 MG/DL. (B)(6) PERFORMED A MID-PROTOCOL START AT APPROX 1:30 PM AND CONFIRMED THAT THE SYSTEM APPEARED TO BE WORKING PROPERLY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ERROR OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS REVEALED A BUG RELATED TO STOPPING THE PROTOCOL AFTER A SPECIFIC SERIES OF EVENTS, WHICH WOULD BE EVIDENT IN THE PT'S HISTORY. (B)(6) CHECKED THE HISTORY OF THE PT AND CONFIRMED THAT THIS HAD INDEED OCCURRED. (B)(6) ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE DATA CORRUPTION THAT HAD CAUSED THE ERROR WAS STILL PRESENT AND WOULD CAUSE THE ERROR TO RECUR IF THE PT BECAME HYPOGLYCEMIC. IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE SHORT-TERM FIX TO ENSURING THAT THE ERROR DID NOT RECUR WITH THIS PT WAS TO DELETE THE CORRUPT DATA IN THE DATABASE AND RESTART THE SYSTEM. A TEST WAS SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED TO VALIDATE THE FIX, AFTER WHICH THE FIX WAS PERFORMED ON THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM AT (B)(6) WITHOUT INCIDENT. BOTH PRODUCTION SYSTEMS (B)(6) ARE BEING REGULARLY CHECKED FOR ANY SIGNS OF DATA CORRUPTION UNTIL A DEFINITIVE FIX IS INSTALLED. A SYSTEM UPDATE IS PLANNED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS ERROR.

PER A VERBAL REQUEST FROM THE FDA ON (B)(4) 2012, THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED EVENT HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN INTO INDIVIDUAL REPORTS FOR EACH DONOR. THE ORIGINAL REPORT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE FDA ON MEDWATCH REPORT# 1722028-2011-00153. INVESTIGATION: AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE CUSTOMER'S PRACTICES OF CHOOSING UNITS FOR QC WERE NOT COMPLETELY RANDOM. AT THE TIME, THE CURRENT CUSTOMER PROCESS PROVIDED ONLY TWO METHODS FOR THE PLATELET PROCESSING LAB TO SUBMIT A PRODUCT FOR WBC MEASURING: AS A PRODUCT WITH A "VERIFY WBCS" MESSAGE, OR AS A PRODUCT SELECTED VIA BACKGROUND SCREENING FOR WBCS. THE RUN DATA FILES (RDFS) WERE ANALYZED FOR EACH OF THE INCIDENTS SUBMITTED BY THE CUSTOMER. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENT ON (B)(6) 2011, THE RDF SHOWS THAT THERE WAS LIKELY A PLASMA LINE OCCLUSION THAT CAUSED THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT. CONCLUSION: THE INCREASE IN ELEVATED WBC COUNTS WAS TRACED BACK TO A CHANGE IN THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHICH SAMPLES WERE TO BE CHECKED FOR WBC CONTENT. THIS PROCESS WAS NO LONGER COMPLETELY RANDOM DUE TO THE USE OF A BACKGROUND SCREEN DURING PLATELET CELL COUNTING. CORRECTIVE ACTION: FOR PLASMA LINE OCCLUSION, ALGORITHMS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SOFTWARE FOR THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. THESE ALGORITHMS WILL RECOGNIZE A POTENTIAL ELEVATED WBC COUNT. THE SOFTWARE WILL FLAG THE PROCEDURE TO MEASURE OR VERIFY WBCS IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THE NEW ALGORITHMS WILL BE ADDED TO THE NEXT TRIMA EQUIPMENT SOFTWARE UPGRADE, VERSION 6.0.2, WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING VALIDATED.

however, the silkscreen on the main fuse pcb indicates a 1.0-amp fuse is required. the pressure pump fuse was replaced to meet specification and a review of complaint history was performed in attempts to determine the last fuse replacement. review of complaint history on this instrument showed that in 2007, the pressure was not working. on the following month, a complaint from the customer indicated that the instrument was requiring fuse replacement(s); fuses may have been replaced at this time. in late 2008, during the sme inspection, on first power on, the first error message on the screen was a slide transport error. parts were ordered to replace the motor and wire assembly, as a wire and a burned motor was found on the slide transport assembly. the load sides of the sweep arms were stuck in the autoloader. the next day, the motor, and wire assembly to the slide transport assembly were replaced, which resolved the unit's error message. an autoloader error was observed, but it was due to an extended period on non-use. the sme resolved the intermittent error. the sme observed a worn slide holder, which was replaced. the unit was checked to current manufacturing quality control procedures. a review of manufacturing records, the original equipment manufacturer of the cell-dyn sms found that the instrument was manufactured with 10 clips latching in 1998. the latch at the location beside the vacuum pump and pressure pump at the top rear of the instrument was not included in the manufacturing of this instrument. there was no requirement to have a latch in this location at the time of the manufacture since this location was implemented in 2000. the purpose of the latch is to hold the cables in place. the risk management file (rmf) for the cell-dyn sms (risk analysis version 3.0) under the risk analysis item was reviewed. the hazard source or cause indicates that electrical shock may be due to exposed ac, dc circuitry within instrument, and electrical current leakage or bad grounding. there are four controls (over current protection, warnings in manual, labels shock, and covers on instrument). the residual risk level is low and acceptable. the cell-dyn sms is manufactured according to approved standards. the cell-dyn sms system operator's manual, hazard electrical safety, page 7-5 states: warning: electrical hazard. indicate the possibility of electrical shock if procedural or engineering controls are not observed. an overview of electrical safety procedures is included on this section. section 8, maintenance - replacing the printer ribbon cartridge, page 8-30, describes the replacement procedure. a review of reports for the months of january 2008 through december 2008 did not indicate an adverse trend for list number, for the reported complaint issue. the event is addressed in product labeling. cell-dyn sms system operators manual: maintenance - replacing the printer ribbon cartridge, page 8-30. based on the investigation, the wear of the exposed pressure pump wire was likely caused by interaction with the rear panel door. the routing of the cable after pump repair caused the insulation to be worn off. based on the investigation, a product deficiency was not identified. this is the final report. >< the customer states that he received an electrical shock while performing maintenance on the cell-dyn sms. he also received a blister to one of his fingers about 2mm in diameter. no medical intervention or medications were administered for this event. a service engineer visited the customer site and found that the shielding of the power cable of one of the pumps was damaged exposing the core of the wire, causing a short-circuit with the chassis of the analyzer. the wire was repaired by the engineer.

2840803	1	AS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE, THE FLOTRAC/VIGILEO FAILED TO TRACK RAPID HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES IN AN UNSTABLE CARDIAC SURGICAL PATIENT; "THE PATIENT WAS SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO MECHANICAL PROSTHETIC AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT FOR SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS. HIS PREOPERATIVE TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY (TTE) WAS PERTINENT FOR AN AORTIC VALVE AREA=0.8 CM2, MEAN AND PEAK PRESSURE GRADIENTS ACROSS THE AORTIC VALVE OF 60 MM HG AND 106 MM HG, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRESERVED LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION (>60%) " INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND INTUBATION WERE UNEVENTFUL; THE PATIENT WAS MONITORED USING STANDARD MONITORS IN COMBINATION WITH A LEFT RADIAL ARTERIAL LINE CATHETER, A CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER, AND TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY (TEE). TEE CONFIRMED A RELATIVELY SMALL AORTIC ANNULUS (1.9 CM) TO BODY SURFACE AREA (BSA) (2.35 M2), NORMAL RIGHT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION AND SIZE, MILD TRICUSPID REGURGITATION, AND MILD DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION. WHILE TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT, A MECHANICAL AORTIC PROSTHESIS (ST. JUDE SIZE #21) WAS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLANTED IN THE AORTIC POSITION. INTRAOPERATIVE TEE DEMONSTRATED A WELL-SEATED VALVE AND NORMAL LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION AFTER UNEVENTFUL WEANING FROM CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS. THE MEAN PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE AORTIC PROSTHESIS WAS 20 MMHG; FOLLOWING INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT, THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CARDIAC SURGICAL ICU ON A DEXMEDETOMIDINE INFUSION IN PREPARATION FOR FAST-TRACK EXTUBATION. THE PATIENT WAS SUPPORTED ON A LOW DOSE NOREPINEPHRINE INFUSION (0.03 MCG/KG/MIN). UPON ARRIVAL TO THE ICU, THE FLOTRAC / VIGILEO (3.01) MONITOR WAS APPLIED (NOTE: THE DEVICE WAS NOT USED IN THE OPERATING ROOM). NINETY MINUTES AFTER ARRIVAL TO THE ICU, A SPONTANEOUS BREATHING TRIAL (CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE CPAP OF 5 CM H2O) WAS INITIATED IN PREPARATION FOR EXTUBATION. READINGS ON THE FLOTRAC/VIGILEO DENOTED NORMAL CARDIAC FUNCTION THROUGHOUT THE SPONTANEOUS BREATHING TRIAL. DESPITE THE NORMAL READINGS ON THE FLOTRAC/VIGILEO, ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE RECORDINGS SHOWED A GRADUAL DECLINE IN THE SYSTOLIC, DIASTOLIC AND MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURES. APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR LATER, AND WHILE STILL INTUBATED AND BREATHING SPONTANEOUSLY, THE PATIENT WAS NOTED TO BE UNRESPONSIVE AND DEVELOPED PULSELESS VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA. CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION WAS EMPLOYED INTERMITTENTLY FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR (A TOTAL OF INTRAVENOUS BOLUSES OF EPINEPHRINE 1 MG, AMIODARONE 300 MG WERE ADMINISTERED COMBINED WITH CHEST COMPRESSIONS). FOLLOWING THIS PERIOD, AN EKG REVEALED ACUTE RIGHT VENTRICULAR INFARCTION. CONCOMITANT TEE REVEALED RIGHT VENTRICULAR DILATATION, GLOBAL RIGHT VENTRICULAR WALL AKINESIS, MILD TRICUSPID REGURGITATION AND LEFTWARD BOWING OF THE INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM. PHYSIOLOGIC DATA POINTS FOR CARDIAC OUTPUT PER THE FLOTRAC/VIGILEO WERE REPORTED AS NORMAL LIMITS THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE OF CARDIAC ARREST. THE PATIENT WAS RUSHED INTO THE CARDIAC ANGIOGRAPHY SUITE AND FOUND TO HAVE TOTAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY OCCLUSION NOT AMENABLE TO STENTING. THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN BACK TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR EMERGENT RIGHT CORONARY BYPASS GRAFTING. ENSUING SEVERE GLOBAL RIGHT VENTRICULAR AKINESIS AND RECALCITRANT HEMODYNAMIC INSTABILITY REQUIRED USE OF THE TANDEMHEART RIGHT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE (RVAD). THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CARDIAC ICU IN CRITICAL-SEVERE CONDITION. HIS POSTOPERATIVE COURSE WAS COMPLICATED BY PERSISTENT CARDIOGENIC SHOCK UNRESPONSIVE TO HIGH DOSES OF IONOTROPIC AGENTS. HE WAS NOT AMENABLE TO WEANING FROM RVAD, AND RAPIDLY DEVELOPED MULTI-ORGAN FAILURE REQUIRING THE INSTITUTION OF CONTINUOUS VENOVENOUS HEMODIAFILTRATION (CVVHDF).

4578612	1	ONSITE TESTING OF THE INVOLVED DEVICES BY A SPACELABS FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER CONFIRMED THE EQUIPMENT PERFORMED TO SPECIFICATIONS. THE TESTING WAS WITNESSED BY A FACILITY STAFF MEMBER. A SPACELABS LEAD SOFTWARE ENGINEER REVIEWED THE PATIENT RETROSPECTIVE DATABASE PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE DATABASE REVIEW CONFIRMED THERE WAS A 12 BEAT RUN OF VTACH AT THE REPORTED TIME. THE MONITOR DID NOT PRODUCE AN ALARM FOR THIS EVENT SINCE THE CUSTOMER HAD DISABLED THE AUTOMATIC LEAD SWITCH (ALS) FEATURE. THE RECEIVER MODULE PROCESSES ALL AVAILABLE LEADS FROM THE TRANSMITTER FOR ARRHYTHMIA AND ALARM MONITOR DISPLAY AS DETERMINED BY THE ECG ALGORITHM. THE CUSTOMER CHOSE TO VIEW ONE ECG LEAD AT THE MONITOR AND COULD NOT SEE THAT ANOTHER LEAD HAD INTERMITTENTLY LOST PATIENT CONTACT DURING THE REPORTED EVENT. A TEXT MESSAGE WAS DISPLAYED AT THE MONITOR TO 多CHECK C多 AND THE HEART RATE DISPLAYED WAS 多???多. THIS MESSAGE IS TO ALERT THE CUSTOMER TO CHECK THE PATIENT LEAD.

2208644	0	DURING A KNEE ARTHROSCOPY PROCEDURE, THE FMS SOLO AND DAY TUBING WERE BEING USED. THE TUBING WAS SET UP PRIOR TO THE PATIENT ENTERING THE ROOM. WHEN THE CASE WAS STARTED AND TUBING WAS HOOKED UP TO THE FIELD, THE PUMP DID NOT SENSE THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE AND CONTINUALLY RAN, PUSHING FLUID INTO THE KNEE. THIS WAS NOTICED AND FLOW WAS STOPPED. TUBING REPLACED AND WORKED TO CORRECT PARAMETERS FOR THE CASE WITH NO INJURY TO PATIENT.  THE PRIMING OF THIS PUMP TUBING REQUIRES THAT: THE PRESSURE SENSOR BE ATTACHED FINGER TIGHT TO THE PRESSURE SENSOR PORT;  PRESS THE POWER ON/STANDBY BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE CONSOLE; PRESS THE RUN/STOP BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE CONSOLE;  PRESS THE FILL CHAMBER BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE CONSOLE. THIS NEEDS TO BE PRESSED A FEW TIMES TO FILL THE CHAMBER TO A LEVEL ABOVE THE INDICATOR WINDOW. IF THE FILL CHAMBER BUTTON WAS PRESSED REPEATEDLY BEFORE THE RUN/STOP BUTTON WAS PRESSED, IT WILL CAUSE THE FLUID TO BE PUMPED TO EQUAL THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT THE FILL CHAMBER BUTTON WAS PRESSED WHEN THE RUN/STOP BUTTON IS FINALLY PRESSED. IF THIS WAS DONE, AND THE CHAMBER WAS FILLED TO THE DESIRED LEVEL, AND THEN THE RUN/STOP BUTTON WAS PRESSED AGAIN TO STOP THE FLOW, AND THEN PRESSED AGAIN TO START THE FLOW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCEDURE, THEN THE PUMP WOULD FLOW TO CATCH UP TO THE ACTIVATED FILL CHAMBER CYCLES.  IT IS BELIEVED THIS MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS CASE.

DEFICIT IN THE KARL STORZ FLUID MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WAS INCREASING THROUGHOUT THE CASE. WHEN CHECKING ALL THE CONNECTIONS, THE POLE FELL DOWN THAT WAS HOLDING THE CANNISTERS. THIS WAS FELT TO BE THE REASON THEY WERE NOT GETTING ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS. USING THE MORCELLATOR DEVICE, THE FIBROID WAS REMOVED. DURING THE CASE, ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE KARL STORZ FLUID MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WASN'T FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, FLUID WAS MANUALLY MEASURED.

5245492	0	INITIAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTED TWO CAUSES A: BELT SLIPS/JUMPING B: LOCK SOLENOID PIN DISLODGE/DISENGAGED. STUDIES SHOWED IF THE SOLENOID LOCKING PIN WAS NOT ENGAGED OR BECAME DISLODGED FROM THE SLOT, IT'S POSSIBLE THE BRAKES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT THE MIDDLE ARM OR CRADLE FROM MOVING OR ARREST AN ARM IN MOTION, AND THE BELT THAT LINKS THE MIDDLE ARM AND CRADLE TO THE DRIVE AND BRAKING MECHANISMS CAN JUMP TEETH, ALLOWING MOVEMENT. A VISIT TO THE CUSTOMER SITE WAS CONDUCTED ON 02-FEB-2016. UPON INSPECTION OF THE SOLENOID LIMIT SWITCH PCB, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE SWITCH WAS INCORRECTLY SET UP AND IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE ROUND TIP OF THE SOLENOID PIN TO NOT FULLY CLEAR THE SLOT. IN THIS SCENARIO IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE PIN TO DISENGAGE FROM THE SLOT. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO REPLICATE THE FAULT, HOWEVER FOR THE ISSUE TO OCCUR A FAULT MUST BE PRESENT IN THAT THE SOLENOID PIN DISLODGES FROM THE CRADLE LOCKING SLOT, AND THE BRAKE/BELT MECHANISM DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT HOLDING POWER TO HOLD THE CRADLE AND MIDDLE ARM, ALLOWING THE CRADLE TO EXTEND. TWO INDEPENDENT FAULTS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS FAILURE TO OCCUR, AND IN NORMAL OPERATION THE SOLENOID PIN AND LATCHING ARM ARE SUFFICIENT TO HOLD THE ARM IN THE DESIRED POSITION. RISK ASSESSMENT: TWO INDEPENDENT FAULTS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS FAILURE TO OCCUR, AND IN NORMAL OPERATION THE SOLENOID PIN AND LATCHING ARM ARE SUFFICIENT TO HOLD THE ARM IN THE DESIRED POSITION. IN A SINGLE FAULT (E.G. IF THE SOLENOID PIN FAILS) THE RISK INCREASES, AND THEREFORE MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A SINGLE FAULT. SEVERITY: IF THE PANEL WERE TO IMPACT WITH A PATIENT THIS WOULD CAUSE A MAJOR INJURY. LIKELIHOOD OF HARM: THE PROBABILITY THE HAZARD RESULTING IN HARM IS DEPENDENT ON THE GANTRY ANGLES AND REQUIRES THE PATIENT TO BE ON THE TABLE, AND IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED UNLIKELY. THE IVIEWGT IFU STATE NOT TO OPEN OR CLOSE THE PANEL AT 180DEGREES +/- 45DEGREES, ESPECIALLY WHEN A PATIENT IS ON THE TABLE. THE XVI IFU DOES NOT SPECIFY THE SAME RECOMMENDATION, THEREFORE DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY A USER MAY CHOOSE TO OPEN/CLOSE THE GANTRY POSITIONS. THESE FACTORS COMBINE TO GIVE A LIKELIHOOD OF REMOTE. THEREFORE TH RISK VALUE BASED ON MAJOR/REMOTE IS CALCULATED AS TOLERABLE.><A VISIT TO THE CUSTOMER SITE WAS CONDUCTED ON THE 02-FEB-2016. UPON INSPECTION OF THE SOLENOID LIMIT SWITCH PCB, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE SWITCH WAS INCORRECTLY SET UP AND IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE ROUND TIP OF THE SOLENOID PIN TO NOT FULLY CLEAR THE SLOT. IN THIS SCENARIO IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE PIN TO DISENGAGE FROM THE SLOT. HAD THIS FAILURE OCCURRED WITH A PATIENT ON THE PRECISE TABLE AND THE GEOMETRIC SET UP BEEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PANEL CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE PATIENT THIS WOULD RESULT IN A MAJOR INJURY. THIS COULD HAPPEN AT GANTRY ANDLES BETWEEN 180賊30 FOR IVIEW GT AND 90賊30 FOR XVI. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO REPLICATE THE FAULT, HOWEVER FOR THE ISSUE TO OCCUR A FAULT MUST BE PRESENT IN THAT THE SOLENOID PIN DISLODGES FROM THE CRADLE LOCKING SLOT, AND THE BRAKE/ BELT MECHANISM DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT HOLDING POWER TO HOLD THE CRADLE AND MIDDLE ARM, ALLOWING THE CRADLE TO EXTEND. TWO INDEPENDENT FAULTS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS FAILURE TO OCCUR, AND IN NORMAL OPERATION THE SOLENOID PIN AND LATCHING ARM ARE SUFFICIENT TO HOLD THE ARM IN THE DESIRED POSITION. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVEN WHEN THE SWITCH WAS SET TO THE WORST CASE POSITION THE SOLENOID PIN FAILURE COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED. ALONG WITH THE 2 INDEPENDENT FAILURES IN ORDER FOR THIS TO CAUSE HARM TO A PATIENT THEN THE FAILURE MUST OCCUR AT SPECIFIC ANGLES (180賊30 FOR IVIEW GT AND 90賊30 FOR XVI). INFORMATION GATHERED FROM CLINICAL SPECIALISTS SUGGEST THAT FOLDING AND RETRACTING THE PANEL WHILE THE PATIENT IS ON THE TABLE IS INFREQUENT. THE IVIEWGT INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ALSO STATE NOT TO OPEN OR CLOSE THE PANEL AT 180賊45[?] COMBINING ALL THESE FACTORS ELEKTA RATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF HARM TO BE IMPROBABLE. COMBINING ALL THESE FACTORS THE LIKELIHOOD OF HARM IS RATED IMPROBABLE. A MAJOR AND IMPROBABLE CAUSE CALCULATES A TOLERABLE RISK VALUE. THE MANUFACTURER IS CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING WHETHER THERE COULD BE IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE MANUAL OR THE TEST REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION WHICH WOULD CLARIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF SETTING THE MICRO-SWITCH ON THE SOLENOID CORRECTLY.><IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A HEXAPOD ISOCENTRE CALIBRATION, THE IVIEWGT IMAGING ARM WAS RETRACTED AND WHILST PART-WAY THROUGH FOLDING INTO THE CLOSED POSITION, THE CRADLE AND MID ARM SECTIONS UNCONTROLLABLY EXTENDED. THE GANTRY WAS AT 180 DEGREE AND THE ARM WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREE THROUGH THE FOLDING ACTION. THERE WERE NO INJURIES REPORTED.><THE MANUFACTURER'S INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

THE (B)(6) REPORTED THAT THE INFANT WAS HOSPITALIZED AND LATER RELEASED WITHOUT PT HARM. THE MFR RECEIVED THE DEVICE FOR EVAL AND DID NOT CONFIRM THE CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT OF THE UNIT NOT ALARMING. THE APNEA MONITOR WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED AND TESTED BY THE MFR USING A SIMULATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SMARTMONITOR 2 CHECKOUT PROCEDURE MANUAL (PN (B)(4)). THE APNEA MONITOR DETECTED AND ALARMED APPROPRIATELY FOR SIMULATED EVENTS AND PASSED ALL REQUIRED TESTING. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 WAS SET UP WITH A 16 SECOND DELAY BEFORE RECORDING APNEAS AND A 20 SECOND DELAY BEFORE ANNUNCIATING AND RECORDING ALARM FOR AN APNEA CONDITION. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 WAS PROGRAMMED WITH PARAMETERS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE FOR RECORDING AND ALARMING FOR RESPIRATION AND HEART RATE EVENTS DURING INFANT MONITORING. THE APNEA MONITOR'S MEMORY DATA WAS DOWNLOADED AND ANALYZED BY TRAINED ASSOCIATES. THE DOWNLOADED MEMORY REVEALED THE APNEA MONITOR WAS IN USE FROM (B)(6) 2010. DURING THAT TIME, THERE WERE 56 RECORDED PT EVENTS. ALL PT EVENTS THAT MET THE PARAMETERS FOR AN ALARM CONDITION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AUDIBLE AND VISUAL ALARMS. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 DEVICE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED TO MONITOR PTS FOR CYANOSIS AND HAS NO CAPABILITY TO DO SO. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 PARENTS' GUIDE (PN (B)(4)) STATES IN THE INDICATIONS FOR USE: "THE SMARTMONITOR 2 IS INTENDED FOR USE IN CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF HEART RATE AND RESPIRATION OF INFANT PTS IN A HOME, HOSP OR PORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION IS DETECTION OF CENTRAL APNEA. ITS SECONDARY FUNCTION IS MEASUREMENT OF HEART RATE." THE SMART MONITOR 2 DEVICE IS NOT INTENDED TO PREVENT LOSS OF BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 PARENTS' GUIDE (B)(4) FURTHER STATES: "THE SMARTMONITOR 2 IS A MONITORING DEVICE ONLY. IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE LOSS OF BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY, NOR WILL IT RESTORE BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY. IT WILL NOT PREVENT DEATH. ANYONE USING THE SMARTMONITOR 2 TO MONITOR AN INFANT SHOULD BE TRAINED IN CURRENT INFANT CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR), WHICH IS A PROPER WAY TO RESTORE BREATHING AND HEART ACTIVITY." THERE WAS NO REPORT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY, AND THE MFR WAS NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM THE ALLEGATION OF ALARM FAILURE DURING A PT EVENT. THE MONITOR PASSED ALL REQUIRED TESTING AND DETECTED AND ALARMED APPROPRIATELY FOR SIMULATED EVENTS. BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE INFO, THE MFR CONCLUDES THAT THE DEVICE DOES FUNCTION TO SPECIFICATION AND THAT NO FURTHER ACTION IS APPROPRIATE.

1887311	0	THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT ONE PATIENT SAMPLE HAS GENERATED A FALSELY ELEVATED (POSITIVE) ARCHITECT TOTAL B-HCG ASSAY RESULT OF 484.07 MIU/ML. THE SAMPLE TESTED AS "NEGATIVE" ON A NON-ABBOTT PLATFORM. NO SUSPECT RESULTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE LAB. A SERVICE CALL WAS INITIATED. THERE IS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED. (B)(4). AN ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) INSPECTED THE ARCHITECT I2000SR ANALYZER AND FOUND DRIED YELLOWISH RESIDUE SPREAD BY THE SAMPLE PROBE AND CONCLUDED THAT THIS MAY HAVE CAUSED THE ERRATIC RESULTS. THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF THE RESIDUAL MATERIAL FALLING INTO THE REACTION VESSELS BELOW THE LOAD/UNLOAD DIVERTER ASSEMBLY. THE FSE PERFORMED SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND CLEANED THE WASH ZONE MANIFOLD AND LOAD/UNLOAD DIVERTER AREA. SINCE PERFORMING THE CLEANING PROCEDURE, THE CUSTOMER HAS NOT OBSERVED ANY ADDITIONAL INITIALLY FALSE POSITIVE B-HCG ASSAY RESULTS. A REVIEW OF THE INSTRUMENT LOG WAS PERFORMED. THE RESULT LOG CONFIRMED THE B-HCG RESULTS MENTIONED BY THE CUSTOMER. SINCE THE OTHER PERTINENT INSTRUMENT LOGS WERE NOT AVAILABLE, A DEFINITE CAUSE OF THE ERRATIC B-HCG RESULTS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. COMPLAINT ACTIVITY WAS REVIEWED AND IDENTIFIED NO ADVERSE TRENDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE ISSUE CURRENTLY UNDER EVALUATION. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL (LIST NUMBER 201837-108) CONTAINS INFORMATION TO ADDRESS THE CUSTOMER'S CURRENT ISSUE. SINCE THE OTHER PERTINENT INSTRUMENT LOGS WERE NOT AVAILABLE, A DEFINITE CAUSE OF THE ERRATIC B-HCG RESULTS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.

IT IS SPACELABS POLICY TO REPORT EACH EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH A PATIENT DEATH. SPACELABS SENT A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) TO THE CUSTOMER SITE TO EVALUATE THIS REPORTED EVENT. THE FSE TESTED THE CENTRAL MONITOR AND DETERMINED THE DEVICE WAS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. THE HOSPITAL REFUSED TO ALLOW THE FSE TO COPY OR EVALUATE THE PATIENT DATA IN THEIR INTESYS CLINICAL SUITE (ICS IS A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW DATABASE) THAT STORES PATIENT DATA AND WOULD PROVIDE DETAILS SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED. ONLY ONE ECG STRIP OF THE 12 BEAT VRUN EVENT WAS AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDED THE DEFAULT USER SETTINGS AND SUPPLEMENTAL PATIENT WAVEFORM DATA FOR THE TIME FRAME BEFORE THE REPORTED EVENT. HOWEVER, WITH NO DATA PROVIDED FOR THE TIME OF THE EVENT OTHER THAN THE ECG STRIP, SPACELABS WAS UNABLE TO REACH A CONCLUSION REGARDING THE EVENT THAT OCCURRED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO FURTHER REPORTS OF FAILURE TO ALARM OR PRINT OUT FOR V-TACH FROM THIS CUSTOMER. SPACELABS WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS ISSUE AS PART OF OUR TRENDING PROCESS.

THE ALARM LOGS WERE REVIEWED AND SHOW THAT THE DEVICE DID SOUND AN AUDIBLE DESAT ALARM DURING THE DATE/TIMES IN QUESTION FOR BED (B)(4). THE DEVICE ALARMED SEVERAL TIMES FOR DESAT AND VENT FIB/TACH AND VTACH. THERE WAS NO MALFUNCTION OF THE DEVICE. THE PROVIDED LOGS SHOW THAT THE DEVICE ALARMED AS SPECIFIED FOR DESAT ALARMS AND RED ALARMS. THE DEVICE WAS TESTED AND WAS FOUND TO BE PERFORMING TO SPECIFICATIONS. DEVICE LABELING DESCRIBES ARRHYTHMIA ALARM CHAINING WHERE ONLY THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ALARM CONDITION IN EACH CHAIN IS ANNOUNCED. LOWER PRIORITY ALARMS IN THE SAME CHAIN WILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED WHILE AN ALARM IS ACTIVE OR DURING THE CONFIGURED TIMEOUT PERIOD.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMER ISSUE INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT TEXT, A SEARCH FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, AND A REVIEW OF LABELING. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN A DEFICIENCY OF THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM EXISTS IN THAT MESSAGES ARE NOT PROCESSED WITHIN THE EXPECTED TIME PERIOD. THE SOFTWARE SHOULD BE CHANGED TO RECALCULATE THE TIME PERIOD MEASURED. THE 8275 ERROR MESSAGE OCCURS WHEN A SAMPLE IS UNEXPECTEDLY DETECTED AT THE SAMPLING POSITION, BUT THE TESTS ARE ALLOWED TO PROCESS TO COMPLETION. INPECO WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE BY DEVELOPING NEW FIRMWARE THAT WILL DELETE EXTRA PENDING MESSAGES AND AVOID THE 8275 ERROR. THE COMPLAINT ISSUE INVOLVES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ACCELERATOR APS AND THE ARCHITECT SYSTEMS. TRACKING AND TRENDING IDENTIFIED NO ADVERSE TRENDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS COMPLAINT ISSUE. LABELING WAS REVIEWED AND FOUND TO BE ADEQUATE.
1062213	1	THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE DEVICE MALFUNCTIONED OR FAILED TO PERFORM AS DESIGNED AND INTENDED. THEREFORE, THE MFR AND UF HAVE AGREED THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO EVALUATE THE DEVICE. WE ARE CONSIDERING THAT A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE ALARM SETTINGS ON THE PART OF THE HOSP NURSING STAFF RESULTED IN A DELAY IN PROVIDING THERAPY FOR THIS PT AND THIS DELAY CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS A FACTOR IN THE PT'S DEATH. ADDITIONALLY, THE AVAILABLE INFO SUGGESTS THAT THE HOSP NURSING STAFF MAY HAVE FAILED TO CHECK AND VERIFY ALARM LIMITS EACH TIME A PARAMETER WAS USED TO ENSURE THEY WERE APPROPRIATE FOR PT BEING MONITORED. NOTE ALSO THAT THE USERS HAD THE INCORRECT IFU FOR THE MONITOR (SEE BELOW). DURING THE INVESTIGATION, THE USER STATED THAT THEY FELT THE TRAINING REC'D WHEN THE SYS WAS INITIALLY INSTALLED WAS AN 'OVERVIEW ONLY' WITH NO SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CONFIGURE THE POWER UP DEFAULT SETTINGS. HOWEVER, REVIEW OF THE POWER UP DEFAULT SETTINGS OF THE UF'S BEDSIDE MONITORS SHOWED THAT ALL BEDSIDE MONITORS WERE NOT SET TO FACTORY DEFAULT SETTINGS AS ORIGINALLY INDICATED BY THE UF FOLLOWING THE PT EVENT. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT THE DEFAULT SETTINGS WERE BEING CHANGED BY HOSP'S STAFF. DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE USER POSSESSED THE INCORRECT OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR THEIR MODEL NUMBER OF BESIDE MONITOR. THE BILL OF MATERIALS FOR THE SHIPMENT TO THE CUSTOMER WAS ORDERED AND THE CORRECT MANUAL WAS RECORDED AS SHIPPED. HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER CLAIMS THE INCORRECT MANUAL WAS RECORDED AS SHIPPED. HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER CLAIMS THE INCORRECT MANUAL WAS RECEIVED BY THEM. THE MFR REVIEWED ALL RECORDS AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE NO REPORTS MADE THAT THE UF REC'D AN INCORRECT OPERATIONS MANUAL. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REQUESTS BY THIS UF FOR ADD'L TRAINING ON THE MONITORING SYS IN THE TWO YRS OF MONITORING SINCE THE INSTALLATION. ONLY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS PT EVENT WERE THESE PROBLEMS REPORTED TO THE MFR. UPON INSTALLATION OF BESIDE MONITORS AND CENTRAL STATION SYS, USERS ARE ROUTINELY PROVIDED WITH OPERATIONS MANUALS, QUICK REFERENCE GUIDES AND IN-SVC TRAINING CONDUCTED BY A CLINICAL APPLICATIONS SPECIALIST. DURING IN-SVC TRAINING, CHECKLISTS AND IN-SVC GUIDES ARE UTILIZED BY THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS SPECIALIST TO ENSURE THAT ALL IMPORTANT POINTS ARE CONSISTENTLY COVERED WITH EACH USER BEING TRAINED. A REVIEW OF THE CHECKLISTS AND IN-SVC GUIDES UTILIZED IN INITIAL USER TRAINING SHOWED THAT THE TRAINING ADEQUATELY COVERS THE SETTING OF ALARMS AND POTENTIAL ALARM ISSUES, INCLUDING: ALARM SUSPENDED FEATURE, TAILORING PT ALARMS TO FIT THE CLINICAL SCENARIO, THE EFFECTS OF TURNING OFF ALARMS AT THE CENTRAL STATION VS. BEDSIDE, AND THE SYMBOLS DISPLAYED BY THE MONITORING SYS WHEN ALARMS ARE ON (BELL) VS. OFF (BELL WITH 'X' THROUGH IT). FINALLY FOLLOWING INITIAL INSTALLATION AND IN-SVC TRAINING, USERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE MFR'S TECHNICAL SUPPORT STAFF, WHICH IS AVAILABLE 24 HRS A DAY TO GET ADD'L INFO OR REPORT ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE MONITORING SYS. AT THE REQUEST OF THIS UF, THE MFR HAS PROVIDED FIVE ADD'L IN-SVC TRAINING CLASSES FOR THE UF STAFF. THE CLASSES INCLUDED STAFF FROM BOTH DAY AND NIGHT SHIFT AND EACH SESSION INCLUDED TRAINING WITH REGARDS TO OPERATION OF THE MONITOR: TRACE SELECTION, A DESCRIPTION OF EACH ALARM, STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR EACH PARAMETER AND CONFIGURATION FOR POWER UP DEFAULT SETTINGS. FOLLOWING THIS TRAINING, THE UF STATE THAT THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THE LEVEL OF TRAINING THAT WAS PROVIDED DURING THIS SITE VISIT AND STATED THAT THIS TRAINING MET THEIR NEEDS. >< IT WAS REPORTED TO THE MFR BY THE USER FACILITY (UF) THAT THE UF WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH ALARMS AND NEEDED IN-SVC TRAINING ON THE SYS. AFTER FURTHER EVAL, IT WAS DISCLOSED BY THE UF THAT A PT HAD CODED AND SUBSEQUENTLY EXPIRED.
2136552	0	A SYSMEX XT-2000I ANALYZER USED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, (B)(6) REPORTED A HEMOGLOBIN (HGB) VALUE THAT WAS 62 G/L AND MCHC=223 G/L. THE PT WAS TRANSFUSED WITH 2 UNITS OF BLOOD ON (B)(6) 2008. NO ADVERSE EFFECT TO THE PT WAS REPORTED DUE TO THE TRANSFUSION. THE RESULT WAS FLAGGED BY THE ANALYZER WITH A DELTA CHECK MESSAGE AND "POSITIVE", INDICATING THE SPECIMEN RESULTS REQUIRED REVIEW. THE USER-DEFINED ANALYZER FLAG TO DETECT LOW MCHC WAS NOT USED, AND THE FLAG FOR LOW HGB VALUES WAS SET TO DETECT VALUES BELOW 40 G/L. THE SAME SPECIMEN WAS ANALYZED ON THE SAME ANALYZER 13 MINUTES LATER WITH THE SAME HGB VALUE 62 G/L. FLAGS AND MCHC=227 G/L. A SECOND SPECIMEN WAS COLLECTED, AND ANALYZED LESS THAN 2 HOURS LATER. THE HEMOGLOBIN VALUE WAS 72 G/L, AND MCHC=256 G/L WITH POSITIVE FLAGS. THE RBC AND HEMATOCRIT (HCT) VALUES DID NOT AGREE WITH THE HGB VALUES OBTAINED ON THE ORIGINAL, THE REPEAT, NOR THE SECOND SPECIMEN. THE LAB BECAME SUSPICIOUS OF SPECIMEN WITH LOW MCHC'S AND REPEATED THE ORIGINAL SPECIMEN 11 HOURS LATER: HGB=98 G/L, MCHC=345 G/L AND THE SECOND SPECIMEN REPEATED 10 HOURS LATER: HGB=100 G/L, MCHC 355 G/L. THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO SYSMEX AS INTERMITTENT LOW HGB AND MCHC VALUES. REVIEW OF PT SAMPLE DATA ANALYZED BETWEEN 05:33 AND 07:27 (B)(6) 2008, SHOWED A PATTERN OF SPECIMENS WITH LOW HGB AND MCHC VALUES, NO OTHER PARAMETERS WERE SUSPECT. THE OPERATOR RETROSPECTIVELY REPEATED 17 SUSPECT SAMPLES AFTER THE TRANSFUSION EVENT. THE FACILITY REPORTED ASPIRATING A CLOTTED SPECIMEN ON THE DAY OF THE EVENT (B)(6) 2008, AND ANALYZER MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING WAS PERFORMED. THE QC AND HGB RESULTS WERE SAID TO BE OK. THE LAB INFO SYSTEM (LIS) "DECRYPTIC" ALERT WAS SET FOR HGB LESS THAN 65 G/L, BUT NO ALERT WAS USED FOR LOW MCHC VALUES. LIS DELTA CHECK FOR HGB WAS SET TO DETECT 30 G/L HGB DECREASE. AS OF (B)(6) 2008, AN ALERT WAS SET FOR MCHC LESS THAN 295 G/L. ANALYZER QC IS VERIFIED ONLY ONCE PER 24 HOURS. LACK OF RECOGNITION OF A PATTERN OF INACCURATE RESULTS AND MINIMAL USE OF USER DEFINED DETECTION SETTINGS BOTH ON THEIR SYSMEX ANALYZER AND THEIR DECRYPTIC LAB INFO SYSTEM APPEAR TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT. LIS ALERTS AND ANALYZER FLAGS HELP PREVENT REPORTING OF INVALID RESULTS AND ARE CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT PART OF GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE. SYSMEX SERVICE PERSONNEL EVALUATED THE DEVICE AND COULD NOT PRODUCE LOW HGB VALUES. SERVICE ON THE HGB AND SAMPLE ASPIRATION MODULE WAS PERFORMED. THE PERFORMANCE OF ANALYZER WAS VERIFIED WITH PRECISION AND CALIBRATION. QC DATA AND ERROR MESSAGES THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THE CAUSE OF THE LOW HGB VALUES COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. ADDITIONALLY, REVIEW OF THE SULFOLYSER HEMOGLOBIN REAGENT DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR THE LOT ON THE ANALYZER DURING THE INCIDENT DID NOT REVEAL ANY ABNORMALITIES.

2568037	1	ON (B)(4) 2012, A CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT TWO RADIOLOGY RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO SAVE A PRELIMINARY REPORT AS A FINAL REPORT ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT HAVE AUTHORIZED PERMISSIONS TO DO SO. OVER THE COURSE OF A MONTH, INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM CONTINUED BUT NO OTHER OCCURRENCES WERE IDENTIFIED. HOWEVER, MONITORING CONTINUED. ON (B)(6) 2012, THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE PROBLEM RECURRED. THERE WAS NO HARM TO PATIENTS REPORTED IN BOTH COMPLAINTS. MCKESSON MEDICAL IMAGING COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOME RADIOLOGY RESIDENTS AT THE JEWISH GENERAL HOSP INAPPROPRIATELY INVOKED THE "SAVE FINAL" BUTTON INSTEAD OF THE "SAVE PRELIMINARY" BUTTON. BOTH THE "SAVE FINAL" AND "SAVE PRELIMINARY" BUTTONS WERE ENABLED FOR THE RADIOLOGY RESIDENTS' ROLE DUE TO A SOFTWARE DEFECT, WHEN ONLY THE "SAVE PRELIMINARY" BUTTON SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENABLED. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMON PRACTICE AT TEACHING HOSPITALS AND THE WORKFLOW PRESENTED IN THE DEVICE'S USER GUIDES, THE "SAVE FINAL" BUTTON IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY ACCREDITED RADIOLOGISTS WHO OVERREAD THE PRELIMINARY REPORTS CREATED BY THE RADIOLOGY RESIDENTS. IF A RADIOLOGY RESIDENT MAKES A GROSS MISDIAGNOSIS IN THEIR PRELIMINARY REPORT AND CLICKS "SAVE FINAL", IT WILL NOT BE OVERREAD BY AN ACCREDITED RADIOLOGIST AND COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE PT. MCKESSON MEDICAL IMAGING COMPANY CUSTOMER SUPPORT WILL WORK WITH POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS TO APPLY A TECHNICAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

5696219	0	the xn series administrator's guide (ag), chapter 5 - appendix, section 5.2 transportation controller connections (ct-90), subsection 5.2.1 explains the flow of data of the system. the first step is to determine the conveying destination. the rack containing samples is placed in the start yard (st-40) where the barcode terminal (bt-40) reads the sample/ rack label and sends the sample position information to the transportation controller (ct-90). the ct-90 sends the sample position information to the host computer. the host computer sends the sample analysis order by rack to the transportation controller. the bt-40 reads the barcode label at the carry-out position  and sends the rack number to the ct-90. the ct-90 identifies the rack and determines the conveying destination. " "the second step is the analysis of the sample. the ct-90 sends an order to the xn conveyor (cv-50) for a rack to be conveyed. the cv-50 sends the order for the rack to be conveyed to an analyzer. the analyzer identifies the sample from the order and the host computer is queried for the sample information. the host computer sends the sample analysis order. the analyzer performs analysis based on the received order and sends the analysis data to the host computer and the analysis result to the cv-50. this is repeated until there are no more samples to be analyzed. the cv-50 sends the analysis result to the ct-90. the ct-90 sends a query for additional orders." summary: barcodes read: patient b - barcode correctly read at 20:25:39 placed in rack 30 tube position 1 downloaded patient b demographics - per analyzer host log. patient a - barcode correctly read at 20:25:59 placed in rack 30 tube position 1 was not logged in to the lis so no patient demographics were downloaded - per analyzer host log. results generated: results from patient a were generated at 20:26:57 and run in rack 30  tube position 9 - per analyzer printout. results from patient b were generated at 20:31:45 and run in rack 30  tube position 1 - per analyzer printout. rerun information: patient a sample was repeated at 21:00:38 - a sample mixing error occured - per analyzer printout note: these results were erroneous and reported. patient a sample was rerun the morning of (b)(6) 2016 - data was not provided. per user  results were compatible with first run at 20:25:59. the discrepancy in the order of barcode read  location in the sample rack and order of report generation is still under investigation. confirmation is needed to rule out operator error or a communication issues between the analyzer  barcode terminal and laboratory information system (lis). the analyzer runs tubes in the order that they are placed in the sample rack. patient b results generated 5 minutes after patient a indicating that this specimen was placed further down the rack. the host log indicates other patient samples in positions 2 - 8. at this time  we cannot rule out an operator error  such as moving a sample tube after being read by the bt-40 or manually changing the demographics. confirmation of which patient required a corrected report has also been requested.><sample id (b)(6) were run on the xn-10 analyzer. barcodes were read correctly. the same patient demographics downloaded to both samples. the user reported that the sid belonging to patient b was applied to patient a's sample. they verified the patient information in their laboratory information system (lis) was correct. the user stated that the demographic information downloaded was the correct demographics for patient b. review of the host log indicates that when patient a was first run it was unregistered and no order with demographics were assigned to the sample. this sample was run first. an analyzer printout of the results was provided with patient demographics belonging to patient b. it is unknown how the incorrect demographics became associated with patient a's sid. patient b was run next and results were reported. patient a was run again in the manual mode and a mixing error occured. the incorrect demographics from patient b were once again assigned to patient a and these results were reported. a corrected report was later issued. it is unknown at this time which patient results were erroneously reported. this incident is under investigation. a follow-up report will be sent when the investigation is complete. this incident is reported because a communication issue or operator error can not be ruled out as a cause of the incorrect demographics. no harm to the patient was incurred.><further investigation determined that the root cause was user error. when the barcode is read at the bt-40 the laboratory information system (lis) provides the test order and patient demographics for the sample. the user incorrectly moved a sample tube to a different position in the rack after the rack passed through the barcode terminal (bt-40) of the conveyer system. the problem was compounded by the operator not registering the sample in their host computer  so no order information was available for the sample tube that was present on the host computer at the time of analysis. the barcodes were read correctly at both the analyzer and the barcode terminal. the xn software will be improved to change the communication between the bt-40 and xn analyzer  so when the xn-10 reads an unexpected barcode number for a sample that was not read by the bt-40  it will not associate any patient demographic information to the sample. there is a software version update to mitigate operator errors due to moving tubes incorrectly or placing racks at the analyzer that have not been read by the bt-40. it was determined there is minimal risk because results sent to the lis are accurate for the barcodes that are read at the analyzer even though the display on the xn and any printouts would show incorrect demographics. xn-9000 users were provided a product notification reminding them that sample tubes should not be moved  replaced or swapped from their position after leaving the bt-40."

1883413	1	A CUSTOMER ALLEGED AN APNEA MONITOR FAILED TO AUDIBLY ALARM IN A VOLUNTARY MEDWATCH (B)(4) REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE FDA IN (B)(6) 2009. THE FDA FORWARDED THIS REPORT TO US (THE MANUFACTURER) ON (B)(6) 2009. THE REPORT ALLEGED NO HARM OR INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE APNEA MONITOR (SN (B)(4)). A REVIEW OF THE VOLUNTARY MEDWATCH REPORT (B)(4) REVEALED THAT THE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME) SUPPLIER WHO HAD PROVIDED THE APNEA MONITOR TO THE COMPLAINANT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONTACTED BY US (THE MANUFACTURER) REGARDING A SIMILAR COMPLAINT WITH DIFFERENT APNEA MONITOR (REF. MDR 2518422-2009-00011). THIS CONTACT OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2009. DURING THAT CONTACT THE DME INFORMED US THAT THE APNEA MONITOR SN (B)(4) HAD BEEN PLACED INTO USE IN THE COMPLAINANT'S HOME ON (B)(6) 2006, AFTER COMPLETION OF THE CHECK OUT PROCEDURE IDENTIFIED IN PRODUCT LABELING (RESPIRONICS SMART MONITOR 2 CHECKOUT PROCEDURE MANUAL, PN 1020817 REV. 2) AND EDUCATING THE CAREGIVER REGARDING THE OPERATION OF THE MONITOR. THE DME ADDITIONALLY STATED THAT THE COMPLAINANT HAD REQUESTED REPLACEMENT OF THE SUBJECT APNEA MONITOR ON (B)(6) 2006, BUT DID NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THE COMPLAINANT REQUESTED THE REPLACEMENT. THEY ALSO (WE BELIEVE AS A RESULT OF THEIR TESTING OF THE DEVICE) DID NOT INFORM US OF ANY PRODUCT PROBLEMS AFTER THEY REMOVED THE MONITOR FROM THE COMPLAINANT'S HOME. METHOD: (REVIEW OF COMPLAINT AND SERVICE PERFORMED). RESULTS: (NO COMPLAINTS OR SERVICE RECORDS WERE IDENTIFIED). OUR REVIEW OF THE HISTORY FOR THE SUBJECT DEVICE, THE INFORMATION FOR THIS REPORT, AND OUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE DME HAS REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF THE DEVICE MALFUNCTIONING OR CAUSING ANY HARM/INJURY. THIS LEADS US TO BELIEVE THE DEVICE OPERATED AS DESIGNED WHEN THE EVENT THAT LED TO THE CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT ALLEGATION (THAT THE DEVICE DID NOT ALARM AS DESIGNED) OCCURRED. TO FURTHER SUBSTANTIATE OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE SUBJECT DEVICE OPERATED AS DESIGNED DURING THE REPORTED EVENT (AND EXPLAIN WHY NO COMPLAINT WAS MADE AGAINST THE DEVICE AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT) WE COMPLETED A REVIEW OF OUR COMPLAINT DATABASE FOR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE MONITOR SN (B)(4). NO COMPLAINTS OR SERVICE RECORDS WERE RECORDED AGAINST THE SUBJECT DEVICE ON OR AROUND (B)(6) 2006, OR AT ANY TIME SINCE THE DEVICE WAS RELEASED INTO DISTRIBUTION IN (B)(6) 2003. BASED ON THIS FINDING WE CONCLUDE THAT THE APNEA MONITOR IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT OPERATED AS DESIGNED RELATIVE TO THE COMPLAINANT'S ALLEGATION. WE DRAW THIS CONCLUSION BASED ON THE FACT THAT PRODUCT LABELING CLEARLY AND ADEQUATELY DETAILS OPERATIONAL CHECKS, AND CARE AND HANDLING GUIDELINES; AND BECAUSE WE FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT THE MONITOR HAD EVER REQUIRED SERVICING OF ANY TYPE AS A RESULT OF FAILING ANY TESTS AND OR CHECKS, OR PERFORMING IN A MANNER THAT INDICATING SERVICING WAS REQUIRED. THE LABELING WE FIND THAT SUPPORTS OUR CONCLUSION IS INCLUDED IN "THE PROFESSIONAL MANUAL FOR THE SMART MONITOR 2 (PN 1008895, REV. B):" WHICH STATES "THIS RESPIRONICS EQUIPMENT AND THE AUTHORIZED ACCESSORIES ARE DESIGNED TO WORK AS DESCRIBED IN THE OPERATOR'S MANUAL. THE USER(S) OF THIS EQUIPMENT SHOULD NOT USE PARTS THAT HAVE FAILED, EXHIBIT EXCESSIVE WEAR, ARE CONTAMINATED, OR OTHERWISE INEFFECTIVE. THE MONITOR AND ITS ACCESSORIES SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED" AND "THE USER OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR READING, UNDERSTANDING, AND FOLLOWING THE WARNING AND CAUTION STATEMENTS THROUGHOUT THIS MANUAL." ADDITIONAL LABELING STATES THE CAREGIVER HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THE PROPER FUNCTION OF THE APNEA MONITOR USING THE DEVICE'S FUNCTIONAL SELF-TEST CHECKS, AND THAT THESE TESTS SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK OR ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY YOUR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. PRODUCT LABELING ALSO STATES THAT IF THE DEVICE DOES NOT PERFORM ACCORDING TO PRODUCT LABELING (INCLUDING THE SELF-TEST CHECKS) TO CONTACT THE DEALER (DME), AND FINALLY, PRODUCT LABELING STATES "DO NOT USE YOUR MONITOR IF THE ALARM SOUNDS WEAK OR DOES NOT ACTIVATE UPON INITIAL POWER ON" (REFERENCE "PARENT'S GUIDE FOR THE SMART MONITOR 2" (PN 572-4000-00).

THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PT INFO IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(6). THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RDF DID NOT FIND A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WBC CONTENT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. THE SIGNALS IN THE RDF INDICATE IT IS POSSIBLE, THOUGH NOT CONCLUSIVE, THAT THE PLASMA LINE MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OCCLUDED NEAR THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. IF THE PLASMA LINE DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE PROPERLY TO THE PLATELET PUMP, IT COULD CAUSE THE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTEM EXPECTS, POSSIBLY ALLOWING SOME WBCS TO ESCAPE.

938374	0	the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe is used on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer, an automated hematology analyzer. the vendor for the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number 08h49-02 provided abbott laboratories with an improved version of the syringe, which was released for use on 5/8/2007. the vendor sent a letter to abbott stating the hemoglobin syringes with a specific manufacturing code, were assembled with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the plunger tip. the absence of sufficient lubricant causes premature failure of the syringe, which generated 'syringe failed to home' error messages upon installation on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer or shortly thereafter. in response to the vendor's letter, abbott internal nonconformance was addressed via stock sweeps to segregate non-conforming product in inventory. a world wide quality hold was issued 22 june 2007 to remove suspect product from the distribution system and a customer letter was generated to users of the cell-dyn sapphire analyzers. the defective syringes were identified in the customer letter as those packaged and shipped between 08 may 2007 and 25 june 2007. a review of abbott's complaint analysis system from january 2007 to present did not indicate an adverse trend for hemoglobin syringes. as the affected syringes did not meet the vendor's internal lubricant requirements, the vendor provided the following corrective actions: vendor employee retraining for syringe lubricant application was completed on 6/19/07. one hundred percent part inspection of the syringe will be performed and inspection results will be attached to the syringe shipment. abbott syringe specifications were defined for use by the vendor. certification documents are attached on every shipment of syringes. this is the final report. >< the customer contacted abbott regarding the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe used on the cell-dyn sapphire hematology analyzer. the customer reported observing 'syringe fail to home' error message on the analyzer ten days post installation. the customer replaced the syringe and immediately observed the 'syringe fail to home' error message. the abbott customer technical advocate (cta) suggested the customer replace the syringe again, and if the issue persisted, the customer was instructed to call back and abbott field service would be sent to the customer facility. a few days later, the customer was contacted by abbott to follow up. the customer reported, the syringe was replaced as instructed and the issue was resolved. the abbott cta requested the return of the failed syringe for failure analysis. there was no impact to patient management reported by the customer. >< it was initially reported that the device was explanted after an implant duration of zero days. in 2009 (through follow-up with the health-care provider), it was learned that the device was explanted due to a sizing issue. per the operative report two weeks earlier, a 36 mm edwards ring was implanted. 'tee as the patient was briefly unloaded did show about a 2+ central leak and this was judged to be not acceptable so the patient was rearrested with an antegrade dose of cardioplegia. left atrium was reopened and the ring was removed.' the ring was replaced with a smaller size ring. >< (b)(4), concomitant medical products: cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list # 8h49-02. the customer used the suspect device at the customer facility. this follow up mdr for remedial correction 2919069-8/6/07-004-c is submitted late. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number 8h49-02, was manufactured on 30 april 2007 and was identified by the vendor to have been manufactured with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the tip of the syringe plunger. the affected syringes with a package date of 08 may 2007 through 25 june 2007, caused the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer to generate an error message upon installation of the syringe or shortly thereafter. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe was distributed for the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer only and did not impact other cell-dyn analyzers. the issue was resolved when a new cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list 8h49-04, was manufactured by a new vendor and released for distribution on 10 february 2009.

THE SOFTWARE INCLUDES WARNING LIMIT CAPABILITY, ALUMINUM TRACKING, DRAG AND DROP CALCIUM PHOSPHATE SOLUBILITY CURVE UTILITY AND OTHER FEATURES TO ACCOMMODATE INDIVIDUAL FACILITY PROTOCOLS. ACCORDING TO THE FACILITY, THE TPN ORDER WAS ENTERED INTO THE SOFTWARE INCORRECTLY. SPECIFICALLY, A DATA ENTRY ERROR WAS MADE IN REGARDS TO THE VOLUME OF HEPARIN ORDERED. FOR THIS REASON, THE TPN PRODUCED CONTAINED GREATER LEVELS OF HEPARIN THAN INTENDED. WHILE INVESTIGATING THIS INCIDENT, OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT PULLED THE ASSOCIATED DEVICE FILES FOR EVALUATION. THROUGH THIS INVESTIGATION, WE FOUND THE SOFTWARE DELIVERED IN THE VOLUMES ORDERED. FURTHERMORE, THE ORDER VOLUMES WERE PRINTED ON THE TPN LABEL FOR ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION. THE DEVICE WAS FOUND TO BE OPERATING AS INTENDED, WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF ERROR. AFTER PRODUCTION, THE ORDER WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE PATIENT DURING AN 18-HOUR INFUSION. AS THE HEPARIN LEVELS WERE CLEARLY PRINTED ON THE TPN LABEL, THE ERROR WAS NOTED BY HOSPITAL STAFF DURING THE FOLLOWING MORNING'S DRIP ROUNDS. ONCE RECOGNIZED, THE ERROR WAS CORRECTED THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROTAMINE, THEREBY REVERSING THE EFFECTS OF THE HEPARIN. NO ADVERSE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN REPORTED CONCERNING THE PATIENT. THE USER FACILITY HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE PATIENT'S STATUS IS FINE. AFTER LEARNING OF THIS EVENT, OUR SUPPORT STAFF ASSISTED THE CUSTOMER BY ADDING A WARNING LIMIT TO PREVENT RECURRENCE. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE CUSTOMER TO INSTALL MORE EXPANSIVE WARNING LIMITS.

CASE DESCRIPTION: THE INITIAL REPORT SPONTANEOUS REPORT WAS RECEIVED ON (B)(6) 2013 BY IKARIA (B)(4) FROM A MEDICAL CENTER IN (B)(6). IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN THE INFANT WAS TEMPORARILY SWITCHED FROM INOVENT (B)(4) TO MANUAL INOFLO (NITRIC OXIDE) DELIVERY NO WAS NOT DELIVERED BECAUSE A "CIRCUIT WAS WRONGLY CONNECTED". FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION RECEIVED ON (B)(6) 2013 IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS INITIAL REPORT. MEDICAL HISTORY: FEMALE, (B)(6), POTTER'S SYNDROME, HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE (HRF) WITH PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS: MIDAZOLAM, NOBELBAR (PHENOBARBITAL SODIUM), HUMULIN R (INSULIN HUMAN), MYOCOR (GLYCERYL TRINITRATE), CRITPAN (DOPAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE), AND BICARBONATE. A FEMALE NEONATE WITH POTTER'S SYNDROME WAS ON A BABY LOG 8000 VENTILATOR WITH THE FOLLOWING SETTINGS: PEAK INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (PIP) 28 CM H2O, POSITIVE END-EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (PEEP) 8 CM H2O AND FRACTIONAL INSPIRED OXYGEN CONCENTRATION (FIO2) 1.0. ON (B)(6) (HER DATE OF BIRTH), SHE WAS STARTED ON "INTUBATED NITRIC OXIDE (NO) DELIVERY" AT 20 PPM VIA INOVENT (B)(4) FOR HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY HYPERTENSION; SHE WAS ALSO STARTED ON MYOCOR (GLYCERYL TRINITRATE) FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. AT 16:30 ON (B)(6) 2013 THE INFANT WAS TEMPORARILY SWITCHED TO MANUAL NO DELIVERY (NOS) AND "A BAGGING WAS DONE WITH ONLY OXYGEN DELIVERY WITHOUT NO DELIVERY" BECAUSE "A CIRCUIT WAS WRONGLY CONNECTED". FOLLOWING THE INTERRUPTION OF NO DELIVERY, THE NEONATE'S SPO2 DECREASED TO 50% (BASELINE 72%). IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT HER CONDITION DETERIORATED (NOS). SHE WAS "IMMEDIATELY INTUBATED AND NO DELIVERED", BUT DUE TO THE "TOUCHING OF THE PATIENT FOR SUCTIONING" IT TOOK 12 HOURS FOR HER OXYGEN SATURATION LEVELS TO REMAIN STABLE AT 70%. ON (B)(6) 2013, THE NEONATE WAS ALSO STARTED ON MIDAZOLAM FOR SEDATION. ON (B)(6) 2013 THE USE OF VASOPRESSOR CRITPAN (DOPAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE) WAS INITIATED AND THE NEONATE RECEIVED BICARBONATE FOR ACIDOSIS. ON (B)(6) 2013, SHE WAS STARTED ON HUMULIN R (INSULIN HUMAN), AND ON (B)(6) 2013 SHE AGAIN RECEIVED BICARBONATE FOR ACIDOSIS. TREATMENT WITH INOFLO (NITRIC OXIDE) WAS DISCONTINUED ON (B)(6)2013 AT 14:00 (NOS) FOR UNSPECIFIED REASONS. SHE REMAINED ON MIDAZOLAM, HUMULIN R, MYOCOR (GLYCERYL TRINITRATE), AND CRITPAN (DOPAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE). OUTCOME: THE PATIENT "RECOVERED SAFELY" AND "THERE WERE NO PARTICULAR HEALTH HAZARDS". IT WAS DETERMINED THAT "AN OXYGEN DISS HOSE WAS ATTACHED TO THE OXYGEN FLOWMETER AT THE END OF PRE-USE INSPECTION, BUT THE OXYGEN DISS HOSE WAS REMOVED FOR SOME REASON DURING THE MANUAL NO ADMINISTRATION, AND A TUBE OF JACKSON LEASE WAS CONNECTED TO THE OXYGEN FLOWMETER BY USER'S MISTAKE". IN RESPONSE TO RECEIVING THE REPORT, THE PERSON IN CHARGE FROM IKARIA (B)(4) CHECKED THE OXYGEN FLOWMETER OF THE INOVENT AND DISS HOSE AND FOUND NO PARTICULAR PROBLEM. IT WAS POSTULATED THAT "IT DID NOT COME OFF BY ITS OWN" AND "PROBABLY, IT WAS DROPPED BY NURSES". THE PRE-USE INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED BY NURSES AND THE DOCTOR. THE PREVIOUS MONTHLY INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED BY REPORTER. THIS INCIDENT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A MEDICAL ACCIDENT. THE REPORTER SUGGESTS PREVENTIVE MEASURES BE TAKEN SUCH AS A CHANGE IN THE METHOD OF PRE-USE INSPECTION AND A CHANGE OF OXYGEN TUBE SHAPE. IN THE REPORTER'S OPINION, "PROCEDURE FAILURE" WHICH RESULTED IN A "BAGGING DONE WITH OXYGEN ONLY AND NO NO" WAS THE CAUSE OF THE INFANT'S CONDITION DETERIORATION AND OXYGENATION LEVEL DECREASE. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS DETERMINED BY USERS AT THE USER FACILITY TO BE USE ERROR, THEREFORE TESTING OF THE ACTUAL DEVICE WAS NOT REQUIRED. THE MANUAL DELIVERY CIRCUIT WAS MIS-CONFIGURED DURING SETUP BY THE USER AND, AS A RESULT, NITRIC OXIDE DRUG WAS NOT DELIVERED DURING ATTEMPTED MANUAL DELIVERY. RATHER, ONLY OXYGEN WAS DELIVERED AND THE PATIENT'S OXYGEN SATURATION LEVEL FELL. FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT WITH THE USER FACILITY LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO USE ERROR. THE INITIAL SPONTANEOUS REPORT WAS RECEIVED ON (B)(6) 2013 BY IKARIA (B)(6) FROM A MEDICAL CENTER IN (B)(6). IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN THE INFANT WAS TEMPORARILY SWITCHED FROM INOVENT (B)(4) TO MANUAL NO DELIVERY NO WAS NOT DELIVERED BECAUSE A "CIRCUIT WAS WRONGLY CONNECTED". FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION RECEIVED ON (B)(4) 2013, REVEALED THAT THE INFANT EXPERIENCED AN OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASE WHICH WAS CONSIDERED SERIOUS.

2661524	1	AGFA IS SUBMITTING THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING: A SUMMARY OF THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION RESULTS. THE RADIOLOGIST'S DICTATION TEXT IS IN AGFA IMPAX, BUT SHOWS THE TEXT TRANSFER AS INCOMPLETE. AGFA HAS DETERMINED IT IS POSSIBLE WHEN BOOKMARKS ARE DELETED OR MOVED WITHIN THE STUDY REPORT, THE REPORT BODY CONTENT, WHEN NEEDED TO BE SENT TO THE 3RD PARTY (B)(4), IS NOT BETWEEN THE BEGINNING BOOKMARKS AND THE END BOOKMARKS AS DEFINED IN (B)(4). SINCE BOOKMARKS ARE NOT VISIBLE TO THE END USER, A BOOKMARK MAY BE COPIED/CUT/PASTED TO ANOTHER LOCATION WITHOUT THE END USER'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE OCCURRENCE. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE REPORT BODY CONTENT CAN BE MISSING BECAUSE THE END USER UNKNOWINGLY ENTERED THE TEXT OUTSIDE THE DEFINED BOOKMARKS. AGFA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REPRODUCE THIS PROBLEM DURING ITS INVESTIGATION AND AS A RESULT, HAS NOT CONFIRMED A SOFTWARE QUALITY ISSUE WITHIN THE IMPAX CLIENT THAT COULD MOVE OR DELETE BOOKMARKS. AGFA IS PERFORMING FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE POTENTIAL QUALITY ISSUE. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS THE REPORTED ISSUE? CORRECTIVE ACTION IS UNDERWAY TO DEFINE THE BOOKMARKS IN THE TEMPLATE SO THEY CANNOT BE DELETED OR MOVED. THE END USER WILL BE UNABLE TO TYPE TEXT OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES DEFINED BY THE BOOKMARKS. BY PLACING THE BOOKMARKS IN PROTECTED SECTIONS, ONLY CERTAIN AREAS OF THE REPORT ARE EDITABLE AND THE PROTECTED SECTIONS CANNOT BE ALTERED BY THE END USER. BOOKMARKS CAN BE PROTECTED BY USING THE (B)(4) FUNCTIONALITY OF PROTECTED SECTIONS, BUT THE CURRENT ALGORITHM FOR PROTECTED SECTIONS IS NOT COVERING ALL SCENARIOS AND PROTECTING THE TEXT SECTIONS WITHIN THE REPORT. AGFA IS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT A NEW ALGORITHM WHICH NO LONGER USES THE BEGINNING AND ENDING BOOKMARKERS. THE NEW ALGORITHM WILL DEFINE THE PROTECTED SECTIONS IN THE TEMPLATE BY USING THE (B)(4) FUNCTIONALITY TO DEFINE THEM. THE NEW TEMPLATES WILL NO LONGER CONTAIN HIDDEN BOOK MARKERS, THUS DYNAMICALLY PROTECTING APPLICABLE SECTIONS. THE INITIAL REPORTER IN THIS EVENT IS (B)(6). THE AFFECTED SITE'S REPORTING GATEWAY HAS BEEN CORRECTED AND THE REPORT TEMPLATE MODIFIED SO THE DELETION OF BEGINNING AND ENDING BOOKMARKS IS NOT AS ACCESSIBLE. THE EXISTING REPORT TEMPLATE PROTECTION MECHANISM HAS BEEN USED FOR THIS MODIFICATION AND A MODIFIED TEMPLATE HAS BEEN ROLLED OUT AT THE SITE.

THE INCOMPLETE TRANSFER OF THE PATIENT REPORT WAS NOT REALIZED UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT OCCURRED. THE PATIENT DID NOT SUFFER HARM DUE TO THE MISSING REPORT INFORMATION, BECAUSE THE TREATING PHYSICIANS WERE CONSULTED AT THE ONSET OF THE INCIDENT AND RECEIVED ALL OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND THE PATIENT RECEIVED ADEQUATE TREATMENT AT THIS TIME. AFTER THE EVENT OCCURRED AND THE PATIENT TREATED, THE RADIOLOGIST DICTATED THE STUDY. IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO DAYS LATER, THE RADIOLOGIST NOTICED, THE PATIENT REPORT WAS MISSING INFORMATION AND THE DICTATION TEXT TRANSFER WAS INCOMPLETE. THE RADIOLOGIST KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE/SHE WAS THE ONE WHO DICTATED THE STUDY AND KNEW WHAT HAD OCCURRED WITH THE PATIENT. THE PATIENT'S REPORT WAS COMPLETE AND ACCURATE IN AGFA IMPAX, HOWEVER, THIS SITE HAS ANOTHER (B)(4) AND THE PATIENT INFORMATION IN THAT RIS WAS INCOMPLETE. THE AGFA HEALTHCARE RIS IS ONLY USED AS A REPORTING GATEWAY (AGFA'S RIS IS EMBEDDED IN (B)(4) TO ENABLE SPEECH RECOGNITION), THEN THE REPORT (BODY) IS SENT TO THE CUSTOMER'S MAIN RIS IN THIS INCIDENT (B)(4). EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO REPORTED HARM TO THE PATIENT DUE TO THE MISSING REPORT, THERE IS A PROBABILITY THAT SERIOUS INJURY COULD OCCUR TO OTHER PATIENTS IF THE EVENT WERE TO RECUR. AN INCOMPLETE RIS REPORT MAY BE OBVIOUS TO A READER; HOWEVER, THE MISSING INFORMATION MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS AND MAY CONTAIN CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO A PATIENT, THEREFORE, THIS EVENT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION.

THE DIAGMAGNETCOUNTS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY 1 WITH EVERY MAGNET SWIPE PERFORMED UNTIL IT REACHES THE MAXIMUM OF 65,535 MAGNET SWIPES. WHEN PERFORMING A MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTIC TEST, THE PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE READS THE DIAGMAGNETCOUNTS AND LOOKS FOR IT TO INCREMENT BY 1, INDICATING THAT A MAGNET SWIPE WAS PERFORMED. AS THE COUNTER HAD MAXED OUT, THE NUMBER WAS NO LONGER INCREMENTING. THEREFORE THE SOFTWARE ASSUMED THAT A MAGNET SWIPE HAD NOT OCCURRED AND PROVIDED THE "MAGNET SWIPE NOT DETECTED" MESSAGE TO THE USER. REVIEW OF THE SOURCE CODE DOES INDICATE THAT THE MAGNET SWIPES ARE REGISTERING AND THAT THE PROGRAMMED THERAPY IS BEING DELIVERED. THE SOFTWARE AND GENERATOR APPEAR TO BE FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED; HOWEVER DUE TO A DESIGN LIMITATION, MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTICS CANNOT BE PERFORMED.><IT WAS REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO PERFORM MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTICS. HE INDICATED THAT HE WOULD SWIPE THE MAGNET AND THEN ATTEMPT TO PERFORM THE TEST, BUT THE TEST WOULD COME BACK WITH AN ERROR MESSAGE INDICATING THAT THE GENERATOR WAS NOT SENSING A MAGNET SWIPE. HE THEN WENT ON TO SAY THAT, HE KNOWS THAT A MAGNET SWIPE OCCURRED BECAUSE WHEN HE WENT BACK TO CHECK THE MAGNET ACTIVATIONS HISTORY, THE MAGNET SWIPE SHOWED UP. HE PROVIDED THE PATIENT'S MAGNET SETTINGS AND SWIPING TECHNIQUE WAS VERIFIED. HE INDICATED THAT HE WOULD SWIPE THE MAGNET AND THEN IMMEDIATELY RUN THE DIAGNOSTICS TEST. THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTICS MULTIPLE TIMES AND WAS STILL RECEIVING THE SAME ERROR MESSAGE. THE MAGNET HISTORY WAS CHECKED AND, PER THE PHYSICIAN, ALL OF THE ACTIVATIONS SHOWED UP. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO PERFORM SYSTEM MODE DIAGNOSTICS WITHOUT ISSUE, AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK, NO SPECIFICS PROVIDED. THE PHYSICIAN WENT ON TO INDICATE, THAT HE DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE MAGNET, AND BELIEVED THAT MAGNET STIMULATION WAS OCCURRING, HOWEVER STATED THAT THE PATIENT DOES NOT RESPOND ( PHYSICALLY/ VERBALLY) TO STIMULATION, AND NEVER HAS. HE ALSO INDICATED THAT PER THE PATIENT'S CAREGIVERS, THE MAGNET SWIPES HAVE NOT BEEN AS EFFECTIVE FOR THE PATIENT RECENTLY. HOWEVER THE PHYSICIAN FELT THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN RELATED TO A LOWER ON TIME AND DIFFERENT SETTINGS CHOICES AS THE PATIENT HAD BEEN SEEING A DIFFERENT VNS TREATING PHYSICIAN WHO HAD THE PATIENT PROGRAMMED TO 30SEC ON TIME FOR THE MAGNET AND NOT 60SEC. THE PROGRAMMING HISTORY FROM THE DATE OF THE EVENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED BUT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED BY THE MANUFACTURER TO DATE. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME.><PRODUCT INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED ON (B)(6) 2012 AND ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING HISTORY WAS RECEIVED AND REVIEWED ON (B)(6) 2012. ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAMMING HISTORY REVEALED THAT THE MAGNET SWIPES WERE REGISTERING AND WERE PROVIDING THE PROGRAMMED AMOUNT OF OUTPUT CURRENT. IT APPEARS THAT THE MAGNET SWIPE ISSUE MAY BE THE RESULT OF A COMMUNICATION ERROR. IT IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN IF A MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTIC HAS BEEN PERFORMED SUCCESSFULLY SINCE THE INITIAL REPORT OF THIS EVENT.

AT APPROX 2:30 PM, THE SYSTEM WAS BEING RE-POSITIONED FOR A STANDING KNEE EXAM. THE RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE SYSTEM STOPPED WITH AN ERROR CODE (E06). THE RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN CONTACTED THE IDC AUTHORIZED SERVICE TECHNICIAN AND BASED ON HIS INSTRUCTIONS, THE POWER WAS RESET ASSUMING IT WAS AN ERROR CODE FOR THE GENERATOR. THE E06 ERROR CLEARED WHEN THE POWER WAS RESET. THE RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN THEN REDUCED THE SOURCE TO IMAGE DISTANCE (SID) AND THE XPLORER 1600 SYSTEM C-ARM SUFFERED AN UNCONTROLLED CRASH TO THE FLOOR. THE SYSTEM WAS PUT "OUT OF ORDER" AND HELP WAS REQUESTED FROM THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS. NO PT WAS INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT. THERE WAS NO INJURY TO ANY HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. THERE WAS NO ACCIDENTAL RADIATION EXPOSURE. (B)(6) SUBMITTED THE ATTACHED MDR TO FDA ON (B)(6) 2006. HOWEVER IMAGING DYNAMICS COMPANY COULD NOT VERIFY THEIR SUBMISSION AND DECIDED TO SEND THIS REPORT AFTER DISCUSSION WITH FDA INSPECTOR WHO INSPECTED IMAGING DYNAMICS COMPANY IN (B)(6) 2006. DUE TO THIS REASON THIS ANCILLARY 3RD PARTY REPORT IS NOT MEETING THE 30-DAY INITIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. A TEMPORARY RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN WAS IN THE X-RAY ROOM AT THE TIME OF THE PROBLEM. THE X-RAY UNIT WAS IN POSITION FOR A 72" CHEST X-RAY, AND HE WAS STARTING TO BRING IT INTO POSITION TO DO A STANDING KNEE X-RAY. THE MOTION WAS ROUGH, AND HE ENCOUNTERED AN E06 ERROR CODE. ACCORDING TO THE TECHNICIAN, THERE WAS NO OBSTRUCTION TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE C-ARM. HE CALLED ON A MORE EXPERIENCED TECHNICIAN FOR ASSISTANCE. THEY RECYCLED POWER AND THE ERROR CODE CLEARED. AS THEY DROVE THE C-ARM DOWN, THE UNIT CRASHED FROM ABOUT 30 INCHES HEIGHT TO THE FLOOR. THE TECHNICIAN STATED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE UNIT WAS IN "FREE FALL" RATHER THAN A RAPID DRIVE DOWNWARD. IMAGING DYNAMICS CO (IDC) IS REPORTING THIS INCIDENT AS MFR AND SYSTEM INTEGRATOR OF THE X1600 DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHIC SYSTEM (COMPROMISING OF THE IDC XPLORER 1000 DETECTOR HEAD AND SEDECAL'S X PLUS LP RADIOLOGIC STAND). BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION BY IDC AND SEDECAL, AN INTERMEDIATE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) WAS ISSUED ON (B)(6) 2006 TO ALL USERS OF XPLORER 1600 UNITS. THE FAULTY UNIT WAS SHIPPED TO (B)(6) FACILITY IN (B)(6) FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED AS LOOSE REAR BEARINGS IN THE CARRIAGE ASSEMBLY ON THE STAND. THIS CAN CAUSE LATERAL PLAY OF THE COMPLETE ASSEMBLY AND UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES CAN CAUSE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE NOT TO ACTIVATE WHEN NEEDED. ON (B)(6) 2006 A SECOND TSB WAS ISSUED TO ALL END USERS, DEALERS AND SERVICE TECHNICIANS TO INSPECT ALL UNITS AND ADJUST/REPAIR AS NECESSARY. THE IDC XPLORER 1600 SERVICE MANUAL WAS REVISED TO INCLUDE THIS CHECK AS A PERIODIC MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY. AS REQUESTED BY SEDECAL, A THIRD TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN WAS ISSUED ON (B)(6) 2006 TO ADDRESS THE ERROR E06 FUNCTIONALITY CHECK.

5951225	0	a customer reported a discrepant result when using the bact/alert? fa plus culture bottle. the culture bottle flagged positive and was sub-cultured to reveal an environmental contaminant; however, the healthcare professional determined the patient is not infected by that organism. the customer reported there were no signs of contamination, yellow-colored sensors or turbid media present prior to inoculation. when specifically asked, the customer indicated that no death, injury or mistreatment was associated with this issue. the customer could not identify the exact lot involved within the complaint; however, was able to narrow it down to either lot 3046221 (exp. 01-mar-2017) or lot 3046537 (exp. 14-apr-2017). biomerieux has initiated an investigation into this issue.><an internal biom?rieux investigation concluded the following: the organisms are not present within the bottle when received at the sites, but rather is introduced to the bottle during inoculation at the testing site. the broad range of species and strains recovered indicate the contaminants do not stem from a single source. testing practices or environmental conditions at the testing site are the root causes. the root cause is not within the control of biom?rieux. an info bulletin will be issued to the field that describes the investigation results and reemphasizes the preparation protocol described in the package insert.                                                              
6157633	1	the cpoe system, epic, is one of the largest in the united states. epic has an inherent problem: orders for medication show up in the medication administration charting (mar) section in an erroneous, and, i believe, confusing and possible dangerous manner. the mar, and the label that issues from the printer in epic, confuses product strength with dose. for example, a 3 mg daily dose of sirolimus appears as sirolimus tablet 3 mg; dose 3 mg oral daily. sirolimus is not marketed in a 3 mg tablet. similarly  any dose of a product that does not exactly match the tablet strength appears in the same confusing pattern: e.g.  a dose of mesalamine capsules 1600 mg appears as "mesalamine capsule 1600 mg dose 1600 mg etc." mesalamine is not marketed as a 1600 mg capsule. the above should read  correctly  in the mar (and on labels) as: sirolimus tablet (or tablets) 1 mg  dose 3 mg  and mesalamine capsule (or capsules) 400 mg  dose 1600 mg  etc. this inherent software error has widespread distribution  i believe  and should be rectified. my attempts to point out this problem have been ignored locally. severity: circumstances or events have capacity to cause error.

2424884	1	YESTERDAY AROUND 2:30, WHILE I WAS TRYING TO ENTER THE PATIENTS EDUCATION CHECKS OFF, A SCREEN WOULD POP UP THAT SAID AN ERROR TO THE APPLICATION OCCURRED. WHEN THIS OCCURRED I CLOSED OUT THE CARDIAC SCIENCE APPLICATION AND THEN REOPENED IT. WHEN I REOPENED IT, THREE PATIENTS WERE RESTORED, BUT I HAD TO RE-ADMIT THE OTHER THREE IN THE CLASS. I WENT BACK IN AND TRIED TO ENTER THE EDUCATION THREE ADDITIONAL TIMES, BUT THE SAME THING OCCURRED. IT RESTORED THE SAME THREE PATIENTS EACH TIME, AND I HAD TO RE-ADMIT THE SAME THREE EACH TIME. THIS IS WHEN WE CALLED YOU CLINICAL ENGINEERING AND THEY SUGGESTED HOLDING OFF ON MAKING AN ENTRY INTO THE EDUCATION DATA, AND TRYING AGAIN TO MAKE ENTRIES BETWEEN CLASSES. AT 3:45 ANOTHER CLINICIAN TOOK OVER FOR ME AND WAS ABLE TO ENTER IN THE EDUCATION FOR THE 3:45 CLASS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. I CALLED BIOMED AND LET CLINICAL ENGINEERING KNOW SHE DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEMS." THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE IN THIS FASHION. THEY HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WHERE THE SYSTEM WOULD SHUT DOWN. THIS WAS CORRECTED WITH A POWER SUPPLY REPLACEMENT, BY CLINICAL ENGINEERING. AFTER TALKING WITH CARDIAC SCIENCE WHO CONFERRED WITH THE CARDIAC SCIENCE, PRODUCT SPECIALIST THEY STATED THAT THIS IS A KNOWN "GLITCH" AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM A RESOLUTION IS NOT NEAR. CARDIAC SCIENCE REPRESENTATIVE SEEMED FRUSTRATED WITH THE SOFTWARE ENGINEER THAT CREATED THE PACKAGE, STATING THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW FOR DIFFERENT WORKFLOWS WITHIN HIS DESIGN. THE ENGINEER IS NO LONGER EMPLOYED WITH CARDIAC SCIENCE. CARDIAC SCIENCE PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATION. WHILE MONITORING PATIENTS DURING THE CLASS, DO NOT GO INTO TO THE PATIENT CARE PLAN AND ENTER ANY DATA. ONLY ENTER PATIENT CARE INFORMATION BEFORE OR AFTER THE CLASS. THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS PROBLEM IS INCONSISTENT, BUT DOES APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO ENTERING INFORMATION IN THE PATIENT CARE PLAN, EDUCATION AREA. THIS SEEMS TO CAUSE THE PROBLEM DESCRIBED. CARDIAC SCIENCE DOES NOT PROVIDE A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE ADDRESSING THIS "KNOWN" PROBLEM.

2662704	0	THE HOSP REPORTED A PT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY BREATHING ONE HOUR AFTER A HEAT AND MOISTURE EXCHANGE FILTER (HMEF) WAS REPLACED. THE PT WAS UNDER MECHANICAL VENTILATION IN BI-LEVEL POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (BIPAP) MODE AND BEGAN TO HAVE DIFFICULTIES BREATHING. AUSCULTATION SHOWED NO LUNG PATHOLOGY TO CAUSE THE DIFFICULTY BREATHING SO THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL THOUGHT THE DIFFICULTY WAS DUE TO ANXIETY AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED THE PT TO BED AND ADMINISTERED 25 MG OF TRANXILLIUM. FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER, THE PT BECAME SWEATY AND CYANOTIC. THE RESPIRATOR COULD NOT DELIVER BIPAP VENTILATION VOLUME AND SWITCHED TO INTERMITTENT POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION (IPPV) MODE. THE PT WAS INDUCED TO SLEEP. THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL THOUGHT, THE DIFFICULTY BREATHING WAS DUE TO AN OBSTRUCTION OF THE TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE DUE TO SECRETIONS BECAUSE THE PT COULD NOT BE VENTILATED USING A MANUAL RESUSCITATOR. TREATMENT FOR BRONCHOSPASM WAS BEGUN BECAUSE THE PT'S CHEST DID NOT LIFT AND NO BREATH SOUNDS WERE HEARD. ..

1986786	0	A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BECKMAN COULTER INC., (BCI) STATED THAT THE LABORATORY TECHNICIAN WAS SPRAYED IN THE EYES WITH RETIC CLEARING SOLUTION (REAGENT B) FROM THE COULTER LH 750 ANALYZER. THE DAY BEFORE THIS EVENT OCCURRED, THE INSTRUMENT OPERATOR WAS TROUBLESHOOTING (TS) A RETIC CONTROL RECOVERY ISSUE AND LEFT THE SIDE COVER OFF AND RESET THE INSTRUMENT. THE FOLLOWING DAY, A LABORATORY TECHNICIAN (LAB TECH), JUST COMING ON SHIFT, WALKED BY THE ANALYZER AND HEARD A BEEPING NOISE. WHEN SHE LOOKED OVER AT THE INSTRUMENT SHE GOT SPRAYED WITH REAGENT B. THERE WAS CONTACT TO MUCOUS MEMBRANES (EYES) WITH ONLY REAGENT B. THE LAB TECH WAS WEARING GLOVES AND GOWN, BUT NO GOGGLES. THE LAB TECH WENT TO THE ER AND WAS TREATED WITH GENERAL CARE AND WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK. PER FOLLOW UP INFORMATION, THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THAT THE LAB TECH IS DOING FINE. THERE WAS NO DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT BUT IT RESULTED IN AN INJURY THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS DISPATCHED FOR THIS EVENT. THE FSE REPLACED THE RETIC SHEAR VALVE AND THE PINCH VALVE TUBING FOR THE CLEARING SOLUTION PUMP. INSTRUMENT IS CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL AND ALL CONTROLS ARE IN RANGE. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE SPRAYED REAGENT IS THE RETIC SHEAR VALVE NOT ALIGNING WITH THE REAGENT PORTS PROPERLY WHICH CAUSED EXCESSIVE BACK PRESSURE RESULTING IN THE FLUID LEAK AT THE "Y" FITTING. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL EXPOSURE IS THAT LACK OF EYE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) WORN BY THE LAB TECH AND INSTRUMENT OPERATION BEING CONDUCTED WITH THE INSTRUMENT DOOR OPEN. PER LABELING, BECKMAN COULTER URGES ITS CUSTOMERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL NATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS SUCH AS THE USE OF BARRIER PROTECTION. THIS MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, WEARING PROTECTIVE EYE WEAR, GLOVES, AND SUITABLE LABORATORY ATTIRE WHEN OPERATING OR MAINTAINING THIS INSTRUMENT OR ANY OTHER AUTOMATED LABORATORY ANALYZER.

2163546	1	IN OUR FACILITY, THE CPOE PALATE OF THE UNIVERSE OF ORDERS ENABLE THE ORDERING OF CONCENTRATIONS OF DRUGS IN PRE-MIXED BAGS. THUS, INSTEAD OF SIMPLY ORDERING A FIXED DOSE OF DOPAMINE AT E.G. 5 MCG/KG/MINUTE WITH THE EQUIPMENT POPULATING THE WEIGHT FIELD, MULTIPLE CLICKS ARE REQUIRED TO SELECT THE DESIRED CONCENTRATION OF THE PRE-MIXED BAG, AND THEN ENTER THE DOSING DRIP RATE AND WEIGHT -SIC-. IF THERE IS A NEED TO USE THIS DRUG IN SYNERGY WITH ANOTHER, THE DESCRIPTIVE INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DIRECTIONS IS NOT FEASIBLE. IN OUR CASE OF ACUTE COMPLEX CLASS 4 HEART FAILURE WITH HYPOTENSION, A CONCENTRATED PRE-MIX OPTION WAS SELECTED DUE TO USER (A PHYSICIAN) CONFUSION, INEXPERIENCE, OR MISS-CLICK. THE ORDER WAS NOT EXECUTED UNTIL "CLARIFICATION" (THE ORIGINAL ORDER WAS AS CLEAR AS THE CPOE TRANSMITTED IT), WHICH DELAYED THE INITIATION OF THE THERAPY BY 3.25 HOURS. THIS DELAY RENDERED THE HEART FAILURE MORE DIFFICULT TO TREAT DUE TO ADVERSE BODY CHEMISTRY CHANGES THAT PROGRESSED DURING THE DELAY, THREATENING THE PT'S LIFE. THE ORDERING PROGRAMS ON THIS EQUIPMENT IS DANGEROUS, USER-UNFRIENDLY, ERROR PRONE, AND IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO INDIVIDUALIZING MEDICAL CARE.

2794050	0	THE (B)(6) BECAME AWARE OF SEVERAL CASES OF SERIOUS INVASIVE INFECTIONS (FUNGEMIA) DUE TO 'GEOTRICHUM CLAVATUM' BY HEMATOLOGY PATIENTS. SINCE (B)(6) 2012, 27 CASES OF INFECTION WERE REPORTED, INCLUDING 17 DURING AN EPIDEMIC PEAK OCCURRED IN (B)(6) 2012. INVESTIGATIONS IN SEARCH OF A COMMON SOURCE WERE CONDUCTED BY (B)(6) ON THE FIRST 22 CASES. THEIR INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ALL CASES RECEIVED LABILE BLOOD PRODUCTS AND IN PARTICULAR BLOOD PRODUCTS PREPARED FROM SETS WITH REFERENCE CATALOG # 80484. THERE WERE 11 DIFFERENT LOTS INVOLVED IN THE REPORTED CASES. THIS REPORT COVERS THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED ON LOT # 01U3218, USED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE (B)(6). THE OTHER INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN MEDWATCH REPORT #S 1722028-2012-00802 - 1722028-2012-00805, 1722028-2012-00807 - 1722028-2012-00812. PATIENT INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE DISPOSABLE SET IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN FOR EVALUATION. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION PROVIDED AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE IF A MALFUNCTION WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR DEATH OR INJURY OCCURRED. (B)(4). THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ROOT CAUSE: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED, AND SUPPORTED BY SEVERAL PAPERS REVIEWED, THAT THE INCIDENCE OF INVASIVE FUNGAL INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES HAS RISEN OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, MOST LIKELY AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASED USE OF INTENSIVE CYTOTOXIC THERAPY, ALLOGENEIC BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION, AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY. IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THE TRIMA ACCEL SETS, WHICH ARE STERILIZED BY ETHYLENE OXIDE WITH A 12 LOG REDUCTION OF RESISTANT BACTERIA ENDOSPORES, ARE NOT THE SOURCE OF FUNGAL CONTAMINATION. CORRECTIVE/PREVENTIVE ACTION: BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS, THE TRIMA ACCEL SET IS NOT THE SOURCE OF FUNGAL CONTAMINATION. AS A SECONDARY ACTIVITY, TERUMO BCT INITIATED ADDITIONAL MONITORING TO TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF GEOTRICHUM CLAVATUM, WHICH NO PRESENCE HAS BEEN FOUND.><(B)(4). INVESTIGATION: A LITERATURE SEARCH REGARDING INVASIVE "GEOTRICHUM CLAVATUM" FOUND IN HEMATOLOGY WAS PERFORMED IN RELATION TO THIS INCIDENT. THE LITERATURE REVIEW REVEALED THAT "GEOTRICHUM CLAVATUM" INFECTIONS ARE VERY RARE. THE MAJORITY OF CASES ARE IN NEUTROPENIC PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE LEUKEMIA MYELOBLASTOMA. THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO PROPHYLACTIC OR EMPIRICAL ANTIFUNGAL TREATMENTS INCLUDING AZOLE AND CASPOFUNGIN, TO WHICH "G. CLAVATUM" IS NATURALLY RESISTANT. "GEOTRICHUM CLAVATUM" HAS ONLY BEEN REPORTED IN (B)(6). TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE PARTS USED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE TRIMA DISPOSABLE SETS (INCLUDING THE (B)(6) SET) ARE COMMON TO ALL SETS MANUFACTURED BY TERUMO BCT AND ARE DISTRIBUTED WORLD-WIDE, IF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CAUSED FUNGAL CONTAMINATION, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS REPORTED FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. THE TERUMO BCT TRIMA PRODUCT CATALOG 80484 IS TERMINALLY STERILIZED USING AN ETHYLENE OXIDE STERILIZATION PROCESS. THE ONLY KNOWN FUNGUS (MOLD) RESISTANT TO ETHYLENE OXIDE IS "PYRONEMA DOMESTICUM". HOWEVER, AT THE LEVELS OF ETO USED DURING OUR STERILIZATION CYCLE, EVEN THIS MICROORGANISM IS DESTROYED. DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED. NO ABNORMALITIES WERE NOTED IN THE MANUFACTURE OR STERILIZATION PROCESS OF THE DISPOSABLE SET. STORAGE AND SHIPPING METHODS WERE ALSO REVIEWED, WITH NO ABNORMALITIES FOUND. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO CAUSE THIS WERE UNUSUAL IN THAT THERE WAS ONLY DISK SPACE AVAILABLE FOR ONE FULL DISCLOSURE DATA FILE. THE CRASH SCENARIO IS AS FOLLOWS: THEY STARTED, PERFORMED AND CLOSED A STUDY ON PT A. THEY DID SAME FOR PT B AFTER PT A WAS DONE. WHEN THEY STARTED THE STUDY WITH PT MONITORING ON PT B, IT DELETED PT A'S FULL DISCLOSURE FILE. SOME TIME AFTER THEY WERE DONE WITH PT B, THEY RE-OPENED PT A WITHOUT PT MONITORING, I.E. NO FULL DISCLOSURE RECORDING. THEY STARTED FULL DISCLOSURE PLAYBACK AND WHEN THEY SELECTED A 'DATA LOG' NOTE TO SEEK TO THE HEMO MONITOR CRASHED. THE CRASH OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USER ATTEMPTING TO PLAYBACK A FULL DISCLOSURE THAT HAD BEEN PREMATURELY DELETED. THE PREMATURE DELETION WAS THE RESULT OF THE USER FACILITY IGNORING THE MFR'S WARNING THAT THE DISK SPACE WAS GETTING LOW, AND ACTION NEEDED TO BE TAKEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO FREE UP DISK SPACE. ACTION BEING TAKEN BY EMAGEON: AS THIS INCIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF USER ERROR, AND THE APPROPRIATE LABELING EXISTS TO WARN USERS OF THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE, NO ACTION IS BEING TAKEN BY EMAGEON. >< A SYSTEM CRASH OCCURRED ON THE HEARTSUITE HEMODYNAMICS MONITOR WHEN THE USER TRIED TO RETRIEVE A FULL DISCLOSURE THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DETECTED. THERE WAS CONCERN THAT THE DELETION OCCURRED PREMATURELY. AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION (SEE ADDITIONAL MFG. NARRATIVE BELOW), IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE PREMATURE DELETIONS WERE THE RESULT OF THE USER IGNORING THE MANUFACTURER'S WARNINGS THAT DISK SPACE WAS GETTING LOW.

3994218	0	THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR THE INTUITIVE DAVINCI SI ROBOT IS POORLY DESIGNED. THE MICROPHONE THAT ENABLES THE CLINICIAN AT THE ROBOT CONTROL CONSOLE TO HEAR CLINICIAN AT BEDSIDE REQUIRES A DISTANCE OF LESS THAN 3 FEET BETWEEN PERSON SPEAKING AND THE MICROPHONE AND ALSO REQUIRES LINE OF SITE. THE MICROPHONE IS ATTACHED TO A TOWER WITH A LARGE FOOTPRINT, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PLACE IN THE IDEAL LOCATION. IN OUR SETUP, THE MICROPHONE IS LOCATED BEHIND THE CLINICIAN AT THE BEDSIDE. THE VENDOR WILL NOT SUPPORT A SOLUTION FOR PLACING THE MICROPHONE IN A LOCATION WHERE IT CAN PICK UP THE CLINICIAN AT THE BEDSIDE. MOREOVER, THE MICROPHONE IS OPEN AT ALL TIMES SUCH THAT SOUND COMING OUT OF THE AMPLIFIED SPEAKER IS PICKED UP BY THE MICROPHONE, POTENTIALLY CREATING AUDIO FEEDBACK. AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE SECOND MICROPHONE INSIDE THE ROBOT CONTROL CONSOLE IS TRIGGERED BY THE AUDIO LEVEL OF THE CLINICIAN'S VOICE. THIS DESIGN SCHEME CAUSES CHOPPING OF THE AUDIO STREAM. THERE IS NO MEANS FOR THE USER TO REMOVE THE TRIGGERING. FINALLY, WHEN THE AUDIO IS ROUTED THROUGH THE PROCESSOR FOR THE ROBOT, A DELAY IS NOTED. THE SOUND DIRECT FROM THE CLINICIAN AT THE CONSOLE TO THE LISTENER'S EAR ARRIVES BEFORE THE SOUND COMING OUT OF THE AMPLIFIED SPEAKER.MANUFACTURER RESPONSE: THE MANUFACTURER HAS CHANGED THE HARDWARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MICROPHONE AND CONFIRMED THAT THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION IS PERFORMING ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE FDA REGULATORY CLEARANCE OF THE DEVICE AND THE LACK OF CATALOG ITEMS, THE VENDOR IS NOT WILLING OR ABLE TO SOLVE THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION PROBLEM.
