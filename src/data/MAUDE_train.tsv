2042167	0	THE REPORTER REPORTED THAT ON (B)(6) 2011 THE PT OBTAINED THE ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE READING OF 360 MG/DL AND SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR KETONES. AT THAT TIME, THE PT EXPERIENCED THE SYMPTOMS OF NAUSEA AND BLURRED VISION. AT 11:11 PM THE PT CHANGED THE CARTRIDGE AND OBSERVED INSULIN LEAKING FROM THE TUBING CONNECTION TO THE CARTRIDGE, AND THE CARTRIDGE COMPARTMENT SMELLED OF INSULIN. AT 12:00AM THE PT CHANGED THE CARTRIDGE AGAIN, AND HER BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL RESPONDED TO THE BOLUSES DELIVERED. TROUBLESHOOTING REVEALED THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE INFUSION SITE, THERE WAS NO BLOOD IN THE CANNULA, THE PUMP'S PROGRAMMING WAS CORRECT, AND THE TOTAL DAILY DOSES OF INSULIN DELIVERED MATCHED THE BASAL/BOLUSES PROGRAMMED. THE PUMP HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO ANIMAS FOR EVALUATION. IF THE DEVICE IS RETURNED, AN EVALUATION SHALL BE COMPLETED AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED. NO CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME.

INVESTIGATION OF THIS COMPLAINT BY LEICA BIOSYSTEMS IS IN PROGRESS. 
3369763	1	GE HEALTHCARE HAS RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF A DEATH OF A FETUS. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED BY GE HEALTHCARE THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THIS CASE. MULTIPLE CLINICAL SIGNS PRESENTED THAT INDICATED FETAL DISTRESS DURING THE MONITORING SESSION TO WHICH THE OB TEAM DID NOT TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS: LOW FETAL HEART RATE VARIABILITY- A HEALTHY FETUS HAS HIGH HEART RATE VARIABILITY. MATERNAL HEART RATE WAS VERY CLOSE TO FETAL HEART RATE; THE STRIP CHART INDICATED THE MATERNAL HEART RATE AND FETAL HEART RATE ACTUALLY OVERLAPPED 5 TIMES DURING THE MONITORING SESSION, AS SHOWN BY THE HBC INDICATION- A HEALTHY FETAL HEART RATE IS TYPICALLY HIGHER THAN THE MATERNAL HEART RATE. FETAL HEART RATE ACCELERATED DURING CONTRACTIONS- A HEALTHY FETUS WOULD HAVE HEART RATE DECELERATIONS DURING MATERNAL CONTRACTIONS. MULTIPLE MATERNAL PARAMETERS TO INDICATE THE MOTHER WAS AT HIGH RISK FOR A COMPLICATED BIRTHING PROCESS, I.E. SHE WAS OVERWEIGHT, TACHYCARDIC, AND FEVERISH. THE OB TEAM ATTEMPTED TO USE A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE (FSE) TO OBTAIN A FETAL HEART RATE DIRECTLY ON FOUR OCCASIONS WITH TWO DIFFERENT ELECTRODES. THEY OBSERVED NO GOOD SIGNAL FROM THE FSE ATTEMPTS AND CONCLUDED THE ELECTRODES WERE DEFECTIVE, INSTEAD OF CONCLUDING THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FETUS. ONE OF THE OBSTETRICIANS COMMUNICATED THEY DO NOT LOOK AT THE MONITOR STRIP CHART AT ALL. ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE OB TEAM COMMUNICATED THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT OVERLAPPING HEARTRATES AND, THEREFORE, DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE INDICATIONS. THE OBSTETRICIANS COMMUNICATED THEY DID NOT READ THE MONITOR USER'S MANUAL AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND HEARTBEAT COINCIDENCE. THE OBSTETRICIANS APPLIED, REMOVED, AND THEN APPLIED SPO2 AGAIN. WHEN SPO2 WAS APPLIED AND INDICATED A MATERNAL HEART RATE THAT WAS OVERLAPPING WITH THE FETAL HEART RATE, APPROPRIATE ACTIONS WERE NOT TAKEN. THE OBSTETRICIANS DID NOT CONSIDER THE TWO HEART BEATS WERE BOTH FROM THE MOTHER AND THAT THE FETAL HEART BEAT WAS NOT BEING DETECTED. GE HEALTHCARE PROVIDED TRAINING ON THE DEVICE WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY HOSPITAL STAFF SEVERAL MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. THE HOSPITAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THEIR CLINICIANS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED ON THE DEVICE THROUGH PERSONNEL TURNOVER CYCLES, ETC. THE GE TRAINING WAS PROVIDED ONE TIME ONLY AND WAS NOT PURCHASED AGAIN FOR NEW CLINICIANS THAT DID NOT RECEIVE THE ORIGINAL TRAINING. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE WAS USER ERROR INTERPRETING THE CLINICAL SITUATION OF THE MOTHER AND THE FETUS.><THE LEGAL COMPLAINT THAT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY RECEIVED ALLEGES THE FOLLOWING: "THE COROMETRICS MONITOR MADE IT APPEAR TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT THE FETAL HEART RATE WAS BEING MONITORED THROUGHOUT LABOR AND WAS NORMAL." "HOWEVER, AT SOME POINT HOURS BEFORE DELIVERY, HIS FETAL HEART RATE BECAME DISTRESSED. INSTEAD OF PICKING UP THIS DISTRESS, THE COROMETRICS FETAL HEART MONITOR MADE A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO THE MATERNAL HEART RATE, CONFUSING THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS INTO BELIEVING THE BABY'S HEART WAS FINE." GE HEALTHCARE'S INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. A FOLLOW UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED ONCE THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED.><NO INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO GE HEALTHCARE BY THE HOSPITAL ON THE STATUS OF THE UNIT. AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE UNIT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE OR IF IT CONTINUES TO BE USED WITH PATIENTS. NO FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE ALLEGED DEVICE OR THE EVENT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO GE HEALTHCARE. THERE ARE NO SERVICE RECORDS FOR THE DEVICE IN THE GE HEALTHCARE DATABASE. THEREFORE, WITHOUT SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVENT, OR THE EVALUATION OF THE ALLEGED DEVICE, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED ISSUE.

2228247	1	IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE VIGILANCE II MEAN ARTERIAL VALUE (MAP) DID NOT MATCH THE GE SOLAR 8000 (RAC4A) BEDSIDE MONITOR'S MAP. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. A 70ANM5 SLAVE CABLE WAS USED TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION BETWEEN THE TWO MONITORS. THE ACCOUNT WAS A NEW USER TO THE SYSTEM AS OF JANUARY 2007. (B)(6). (B)(4): INCORRECT PARAMETER CALCULATIONS. FOLLOWUP WITH THE ACCOUNT INDICATED THAT THEY ARE NOT RETURNING THE VIGILANCE MONITOR. THE DFU INSTRUCTS THE USER TO VERIFY THE SLAVED MAP VALUES WITH THOSE DISPLAYED ON THE BEDSIDE MONITOR. REFERENCE VIGILANCE II DFU, SECTION 2-6. THE STATEMENT IS AS FOLLOWS: "CAUTION: THE ACCURACY OF CONTINUOUS SVR, VQI AND O2 EL DEPENDS UPON THE QUALITY AND ACCURACY OF THE MAP, CVP AND SA02 DATA TRANSMITTED FROM THE EXTERNAL MONITORS. SINCE MAP, CVP, AND SA02 ANALOG SIGNAL QUALITY FROM THE EXTERNAL MONITOR CANNOT BE VALIDATED BY THE VIGILANCE II MONITOR, ACTUAL VALUES AND THE VALUES (INCLUDING ALL DERIVED PARAMETERS) DISPLAYED BY THE VIGILANCE II MONITOR MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT. THE ACCURACY OF CONTINUOUS SVR, VQI AND O2EI MEASUREMENT, THEREFORE, CANNOT BE GUARANTEED. TO AID IN DETERMINING THE QUALITY OF THE ANALOG SIGNALS, REGULARLY COMPARE THE MAP, CVP AND SA02 VALUES DISPLAYED ON THE EXTERNAL MONITOR TO THE VALUES DISPLAYED ON THE VIGILANCE MONITOR. REFER TO EXTERNAL INPUT DEVICE OPERATOR'S MANUAL FOR DETAILED INFORMATION. REGARDING ACCURACY, CALIBRATION, AND OTHER VARIABLES WHICH MAY IMPACT THE ANALOG OUTPUT SIGNAL FROM THE EXTERNAL MONITOR." DEVICE 2: BRAND NAME: PRESSURE SLAVE CABLE; TYPE OF DEVICE: ANALOGUE SLAVE CABLE; MANUFACTURER: EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES (B)(4). MODEL#: 70ANM5, SINGLE USE DEVICE THAT WAS REPROCESSED?: NO; DEVICE AVAILABLE FOR EVAL?: NO. (B)(4): INCORRECT PARAMETER CALCULATIONS. (B)(4).
1910611	0	RN SENT PHILIPS TELEMETRY PACK TO BIOMED BECAUSE IT PERSISTED IN DISPLAYING 'LOW BATTERY.'  BIOMED CHANGED AA BATTERIES AND GOT THE SAME ISSUE OF 'LOW BATTERY' WITHIN 1-2 MINUTES.  TECH OPENED BATTERY CASE AND ON REMOVING ONE OF THE TWO BATTERIES FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY HOT TO TOUCH.  ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE NEGATIVE POLE SPRING (THE BATTERY TOWARDS THE OUT SIDE OF THE CASE) HAD SLIPPED OVER THE TOP OF RETAINING CLIP AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH WIRE FROM THE BATTERY CLOSER TO THE TOUCH PAD.  THE LOAD ON OUTSIDE BATTERY WAS GREATLY INCREASED AND OVERHEATED.  THE BATTERY INDICATOR WAS DISPLAYING 'LOW BATTERY' ON THE UNIT'S SCREEN.  IN A SIMULATED SITUATION IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE OUTSIDE BATTERY WAS HEATING UP TO ~ 196.5 F DEGREES.  THE PLASTIC RETAINING CLIP 'GRINDS DOWN' OVER TIME.  THERE IS NO APPARENT WAY TO REPLACE THE CLIP. PATIENTS HAVE COMPLAINED THE PACK GETS HOT BUT WE HAD NEVER DISCOVERED THE CAUSE UNTIL NOW.HEALTH PROFESSIONAL'S IMPRESSION: WEAR AND TEAR ON A PLASTIC RETAINING CLIP THAT ALLOWS A NEGATIVE POLE BATTERY SPRING TO SLIP UP OVER TOP OF CLIP AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH SECOND AA BATTERY.  THIS IS A SUBTLE PROBLEM THAT NURSING STAFF CANNOT EASILY VISUALIZE OR FIX.
1709197	1	EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION (B)(6) 2009 WAS PHASED TO 'GO LIVE' DURING (B)(6). (B)(6) THE HOSPITAL EXPERIENCED A NUMBER OF ISSUES. MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF DATABASE SERVER (DBS) REBOOTING CAUSING THE PATIENT INFORMATION CENTER (PICS) TO GO INTO LOCAL MODE AND FOR THE CLIENTS TO GO OFF LINE. MOUSE FAILURES WITH THE REMOTE CPU SOLUTION AND KEY BOARD, MONITOR, VIDEO (KVM) SWITCHES. THE PIC REBOOTS OR GOES BLANK RANDOMLY; PIC RECOVERS, HOWEVER DATA IS LOST DURING THE TIME OF THE 'BLANKING' OR REBOOTING. PRINTERS ARE GOING OFF LINE AND UNABLE TO PRINT. SYSTEM TESTED FOR HARDWARE FAILURES AND OR OBVIOUS CONFIGURATION ISSUES. SOME HARDWARE DEVICES KVM SWITCH AND MOUSE WERE REPLACED. THE RESULT OF THE PROCESS WAS THE PHILIPS LOCAL SERVICE ENGINEER WAS UNABLE TO ISOLATE ANY OBVIOUS SOURCE OF FAILURE. THERE WAS A FORMAL ESCALATION IN (B)(4) TO THE PHILIPS REGION SUPPORT MANAGER. ALL LOGS FROM SERVERS WERE SENT TO PHILIPS MONITORING HQ FOR ANALYSIS. DBS REBOOTS ERROR LOGS INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM WAS THOUGHT THAT IT HAD RUN OUT OF AVAILABLE MEMORY AND CREATED A REBOOT TO DUMP ITS MEMORY CONTENT. PHILIPS ANALYZED THE SOFTWARE CODE AND DISCOVERED AN ERROR IN THE CODE THAT CREATED AN ERRONEOUS MEMORY CAP. A PATCH WAS CREATED IN (B)(4) WHICH CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. PRINTERS GOING OFF LINE WERE HOSPITAL PROCURED PRINTERS WHICH POSSESS 2 NIC CARDS INSTEAD OF ONE. THIS PROBLEM WAS MOST PREVALENT ON THE LEAST ACTIVE PRINTERS AND PHILIPS PROVIDED 2 DIVISION PRINTERS FOR THESE AREAS WHICH WERE INSTALLED IN (B)(4) WITH NO FURTHER ISSUES. PIC REBOOTS ANALYSIS OF THE ERROR LOGS INDICATED 2 TYPES OF ERROR GENERATED BY THE PICS WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE A DOCUMENTED A REBOOT OCCURRENCE LOSS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE DBS AND NETWORK MESSAGING A 'DR WATSON' ERROR (A SOFTWARE ERROR THAT MAY OCCUR WHEN COPYING OR PASTING FILES USING WINDOWS EXPLORER). IN (B)(4) THE MEMORY LEAK PATCH WAS PERFORMED WHICH ELIMINATED THE REBOOTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DBS REBOOT. REBOOTS GENERATING THE OTHER ERROR CONTINUE. REMOTE SERVER NETWORK (RSN) CONNECTION ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE DOWNLOADS OF ERROR LOGS AND DEPLOYMENT OF REPORTING TOOLS THAT CAPTURE AND DRILL DOWN. MOUSE LOCK UPS IN THE REMOTE SOLUTION LED TO INVESTIGATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THE REMOTE CPU AND KVM SWITCH. THE INITIAL TECHNOLOGY INSTALLED EXTENDED THE PS/2 MOUSE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS BETWEEN THE CPU AND MOUSE. THE LOCKUPS TEND TO OCCUR RANDOMLY AND HAVE HAPPENED IN ALL FOUR WORKSTATIONS, HOWEVER, MOST PREVALENT IN THE STATIONS ALONG THE WINDOW. REMEDY WAS TO CONVERT THE REMOTE SOLUTION FROM A PS/2 TO A USB, REPLACE HARDWARE COMPONENTS WITH ANOTHER STYLE, AND UPGRADE TO 'KAVOOM' KVM SWITCH SOFTWARE. THIS SEEMS TO BE WORKING AS THE MONITOR TECH CAN SCROLL THROUGH THE FOUR MONITORS WITHOUT LOCKING UP, HOWEVER, LIMITS THE MONITORING CAPABILITY OF EACH MONITOR TO 12 PATIENTS INSTEAD OF THE 16 PATIENTS THAT ARE ADVERTISED.
5129877	0	THE ANALYZER ALERTED THE OPERATOR TO POSSIBLE SAMPLE ABNORMALITY. THE USER REPORTED ERRONEOUSLY ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) VALUE AS A PRELIMINARY REPORT AWAITING VERIFICATION. THE DOCTOR ADMINISTERED ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY. THE USER PERFORMED MANUAL DIFFERENTIAL AND OBSERVED THE PRESENCE OF NUCLEATED RED BLOOD CELLS (MRBC). THE USER MANUALLY CALCULATED THE CORRECTED WBC VALUE AND ISSUED A CORRECTED REPORT AND INFORMED THE DOCTOR. ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY WAS CONTINUED AFTER CORRECTED REPORTS WERE ISSUED. IT CANNOT BE CONFIRMED IF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY WAS BASED ON THE ERRONEOUSLY ELEVATED PRELIMINARY WBC ALONE OR IF OTHER CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS WARRANTED THE TREATMENT. THERE WAS NO HARM TO THE PT.

IMIX IS REPORTING THIS INCIDENT AS MANUFACTURER AND SYSTEM INTEGRATOR OF SONORAD DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY SYSTEM WHICH INTEGRATES IMIX DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY DETECTOR WITH THE STAND MANUFACTURED BY (B)(4). BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION, INITIALLY, IT WAS CONSIDERED AS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND AN ERROR BY THE OPERATOR AND THE INVESTIGATIONS DID NOT REVEAL ANY ROOT CAUSE FOR THE PROBLEM. AFTER FURTHER STUDIES AND ENGINEERING EVALUATION OF THE UNIT, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AN INTERFERENCE INTRODUCED BY THE ELECTRICAL NOISE FROM THE EXTERNAL KEY PAD CONTROL UNIT COULD RESULT IN SUCH A MOVEMENT. ALL OTHER POSSIBLE SCENARIOS WERE RULED OUT. AS A CORRECTIVE ACTION, A FIELD NOTICE WAS ISSUED TO DISCONNECT THE EXTERNAL KEY PAD CONTROL UNIT. THIS DOES NOT HAVE AN EFFECT ON FUNCTIONALITY OR SAFETY OF THE DEVICE. AS A PREVENTIVE ACTION, IMIX IS PLANNING TO INSTALL A COLLISION SENSOR AS AN ADDED SAFETY FEATURE TO AVOID ANY SUCH UNINTENDED MOVEMENT. IMIX'S INTERNAL CORRECTIVE ACTION (B)(4) WILL CONTINUE UNTIL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORRECTIVE/ PREVENTIVE ACTION IS CONFIRMED. THIS REPORT IS NOT MEETING THE FDA'S REQUIRED REPORTING TIME FRAME DUE TO THE FACT THE IMIX DID NOT IDENTIFY THIS INCIDENT AS A REPORTABLE EVENT. HOWEVER, AFTER CAREFUL STUDY OF THE EVENT/S, IMIX MANAGEMENT DECIDED TO SEND THIS REPORT TO FDA.

2116814	1	A DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME) SUPPLIER REPORTED AN INFANT APNEA MONITOR DID NOT ALARM DURING AN APNEIC AND CYANOTIC PATIENT EVENT. THE EXACT DATE AND TIME OF THE EVENT IS UNKNOWN; HOWEVER, THE DME STATED THAT IT WAS "BELIEVED TO HAVE OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2011." IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CAREGIVER OF THE INFANT PERFORMED CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) AND THE INFANT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR OBSERVATION. NO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY RESULTED. THE MANUFACTURER RECEIVED THE DEVICE FOR EVALUATION AND DID NOT CONFIRM THE CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT OF THE UNIT NOT ALARMING. THE APNEA MONITOR WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED AND TESTED BY THE MANUFACTURER USING A SIMULATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SMARTMONITOR 2 CHECKOUT PROCEDURE MANUAL ((B)(4)). THE APNEA MONITOR DETECTED AND ALARMED APPROPRIATELY FOR SIMULATED EVENTS AND PASSED ALL REQUIRED TESTING. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 WAS RETURNED WITH PRESCRIBED SETTINGS OF A 20 SECOND DELAY BEFORE RECORDING APNEAS AND A 20 SECOND DELAY BEFORE ANNUNCIATING AND RECORDING AN ALARM FOR AN APNEA CONDITION. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 WAS PROGRAMMED WITH PARAMETERS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE FOR RECORDING AND ALARMING FOR RESPIRATION AND HEART RATE EVENTS DURING INFANT MONITORING. THE APNEA MONITOR'S MEMORY DATA WAS DOWNLOADED AND ANALYZED BY TRAINED ASSOCIATES. THE DOWNLOADED MEMORY REVEALED THE APNEA MONITOR WAS IN USE FROM (B)(6) 2011. DURING THAT TIME, THERE WERE 52 RECORDED PATIENT EVENTS. OF THE 52 RECORDED PATIENT EVENTS, 4 PATIENT EVENTS WERE RECORDED ON THE DATE OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT. ALL RECORDED PATIENT EVENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AUDIBLE AND VISUAL ALARMS. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 DEVICE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED TO MONITOR PATIENTS FOR CYANOSIS AND HAS NO CAPABILITY TO DO SO. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 PARENTS' GUIDE ((B)(4)) STATES IN THE INDICATIONS FOR USE: "THE SMARTMONITOR 2 IS INTENDED FOR USE IN CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF HEART RATE AND RESPIRATION OF INFANT PATIENTS IN A HOME, HOSPITAL OR PORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION IS DETECTION OF CENTRAL APNEA. ITS SECONDARY FUNCTION IS MEASUREMENT OF HEART RATE." THE SMARTMONITOR 2 IS NOT INTENDED TO PREVENT LOSS OF BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 PARENTS' GUIDE ((B)(4)) FURTHER STATES: "THE SMARTMONITOR 2 IS A MONITORING DEVICE ONLY. IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE LOSS OF BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY, NOR WILL IT RESTORE BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY. IT WILL NOT PREVENT DEATH. ANYONE USING THE SMARTMONITOR 2 TO MONITOR AN INFANT SHOULD BE TRAINED IN CURRENT INFANT CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR), WHICH IS A PROPER WAY TO RESTORE BREATHING AND HEART ACTIVITY." THERE WAS NO REPORT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY, AND THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM THE ALLEGATION OF ALARM FAILURE DURING A PATIENT EVENT. THE MONITOR PASSED ALL REQUIRED TESTING AND DETECTED AND ALARMED APPROPRIATELY FOR SIMULATED EVENTS. BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE MANUFACTURER CONCLUDES THAT THE DEVICE DOES FUNCTION TO SPECIFICATION AND THAT NO FURTHER ACTION IS APPROPRIATE.
2281136	1	THE TELEMETRY SYSTEM WAS EXPERIENCING SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE SERVER MANAGING THE DEVICE. THIS MAY POSSIBLY BE RELATED TO A POWER SURG. THIS REQUIRED REBOOTING THE SERVER AND ASSOCIATED DEVICES SEVERAL TIMES. IN THE PROCESS OF REBOOTING APPARENTLY THE PATIENT ASSIGNMENTS TO THE TELEMETRY BOXES WERE SWITCHED BETWEEN PATIENTS, RESULTING IN PATIENT LABELS ON THE SYSTEM DISPLAY BEING REFERENCED TO THE INCORRECT WAVEFORMS AND ALARMS. THIS WAS DISCOVERED AND RECTIFIED THE NEXT MORNING. NO PATIENT HARM.

2087765	0	THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR MDR EVALUATION PROCESS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR MDR PROCESS TO BETTER ALIGN WITH CURRENT AGENCY POLICY. WE REGRET THAT THIS CHANGE HAS CAUSED THIS MDR TO BE FILED OUTSIDE THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME. THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE THE PATIENT'S AGE OR DATE OF BIRTH. THE CUSTOMER CALLED TO REPORT AN OPERATOR ENTERED AN INCORRECT PLATELET COUNT OF 476 FOR A DONOR INSTEAD OF THEIR ACTUAL COUNT OF 239. THE CUSTOMER WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IMPACT THERE MIGHT BE DUE TO THIS MISTAKE. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR CALLED THE DONOR AND ASKED THAT THEY RETURN FOR A POST PLATELET COUNT BUT HE REFUSED. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE DISPOSABLE SET WAS NOT RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION AS THERE WAS NO PROBLEM W/THE SET. A SERVICE CALL WAS NOT PLACED BECAUSE THE TRIMA SYSTEM OPERATED AS INTENDED WITH THE INFORMATION THE OPERATOR ENTERED. THE DONOR DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ADVERSE SYMPTOMS NOR WAS ANY MEDICAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED IN THIS INCIDENT. DHR WAS REVIEWED AND NO PROBLEMS WERE NOTED. ROOT CAUSE: OPERATOR ERROR. CORRECTIVE/PREVENTIVE ACTION: THE SUPPORT SPECIALIST WHO HANDLED THE CALL GAVE THE CUSTOMER SOME RE-TRAINING AS TO THE DANGER OF RUNNING A DONOR WITH THE WRONG PARAMETERS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EVENT WAS REQUESTED, BUT NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED. EVALUATION SUMMARY. (B)(4). IT WAS REPORTED BY AN ATTORNEY THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN A LAWSUIT REGARDING AN ABLATION PROCEDURE. THE ALLEGATION IS THAT HIS CLIENTS ESOPHAGUS WAS PERFORATED WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO HIS CLIENT¿S DEATH. HIS UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS A 3D MAPPING OF THE PROCEDURE IN WHICH IT WOULD PROVIDE LOCATIONS AND AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY APPLIED. THE HOSPITAL IS TELLING HIM THAT THEY CAN NOT RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION. THE ATTORNEY IS TRYING TO EDUCATE HIMSELF ON HOW THAT MIGHT BE RETRIEVED. THE USER DID NOT BACKUP THE PATIENT FILES AS IT IS RECOMMENDED IN THE USER MANUAL. IN ADDITION, THE HISTORY OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SPECIFIC SYSTEM WAS REVIEWED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY COMPLAINT THAT MAY BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED ISSUE. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) REVIEW WAS PERFORMED. NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED IN MANUFACTURING OR SERVICE.><INVESTIGATION STILL IN PROGRESS.

DESPITE TREATMENT, THE INFECTION SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE PATIENT¿S BODY AND HE DIED OF FAILURE OF HIS ORGANS ON (B)(6) 2010. THE PHYSICIAN WHO PERFORMED THE PROCEDURE ON THIS PATIENT WAS ALLEGED PERFORATING THE PATIENT¿S PERICARDIUM AND THE WALL OF ESOPHAGUS DURING THE ABLATION PROCEDURE. THE ALLEGATIONS TO THE PHYSICIAN WERE FAILING TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR THE PLACEMENT OF ELECTRODES DURING ABLATION, ADMINISTERING EXCESSIVE ABLATION AND USING TOO MUCH POWER TO PATIENT¿S HEART IN THE AREA NEAR THE ESOPHAGUS, AND FAILING TO PERFORM TESTING AFTER THE PROCEDURE TO DETECT THE PERFORATION OF PERICARDIUM AND ESOPHAGUS. THE BWI LEGAL DEPARTMENT ALSO PROVIDED INFORMATION STATING IT WAS NOT THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE CARTO XP SYSTEM. (B)(4).
1753065	1	THIS EVENT IS NOT PATIENT SPECIFIC, RATHER IT IS A SOFTWARE INTERACTION PROBLEM INVOLVING PHILIPS INTELLIVIEW PATIENT MONITOR SYSTEM AND MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICAL CHARTING SYSTEM. ISSUE IS THAT READINGS OF NIBP DO NOT ALWAYS CHART THE CORRECT NIPB VALUE WHEN THE HORIZON CLINICAL APPLICATION IS SET TO FILTER OR CHART THE VALUE EVERY 15, 30, 60, ETC. MINUTES.OUR PROBLEM IS THAT THE NIBP VALUE THAT SHOWS UP IN MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICALS IS THE VALUE FROM A MEASUREMENT TAKEN 15 MINUTES EARLIER.EXAMPLE: CLINICIAN STARTS AN NIBP READING AFTER SETTING THE PHILIPS INTELLEVIEW MONITOR (IN THIS CASE AN MP70) TO TAKE AN NIBP MEASUREMENT EVERY 15 MINUTES. THE CLINICIAN PUSHING THE NIBP START BUTTON AT 11:55. THE INTELLEVIEW MONITOR STARTS THE INFLATION OF THE CUFF, THEN STARTS DEFLATING, THEN DISPLAYS THE VALUE. THE TIME NOW IS 11:57. AT 12:00 MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICALS PERFORMS A QUERY AND RECEIVES THE NIBP VALUE. EVERYTHING IS GOOD, VALUES ARE CORRECT.THE PROBLEM NOW STARTS. THE PHILIPS INTELLEVIEW MONITOR WILL, OVER TIME, ROUND UP THE NIBP START TIME TO THE QUARTER HOUR (THIS IS A BUILT IN FEATURE OF THE SOFTWARE THE USER CANNOT DISABLE). SO FOR EXAMPLE, AN HOUR LATER, INSTEAD OF THE NIBP STARTING AT SAY 12:55, IT WILL NOW START THE NIBP MEASUREMENT AT 1:00. ALSO AT 1:00, MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICALS IS SET TO QUERYING FOR NIBP DATA FROM PHILIPS WHICH AT THIS EXACT POINT IN TIME HAS NOT COMPLETED THE NIBP MEASUREMENT AND THUS STILL HAS THE VALUE FROM THE 12:45 NIBP MEASUREMENT. THE NIBP MEASUREMENT STARTS AT THE QUARTER HOUR BUT DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE UNTIL THE MEASUREMENT HAS COMPLETED WHICH MIGHT TAKE ANYWHERE FROM 45 SECONDS TO 3 MINUTES DEPENDING ON IF THE MONITOR HAS TO RETRY 2 OR 3 TIMES, ETC.IN CRITICAL CARE AREAS PATIENTS ARE MONITORED CLOSELY FOR THE EFFICACY OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, ESPECIALLY VASOACTIVE DRUGS. A DELAYED READING OF BLOOD PRESSURE COULD LEAD THE BEDSIDE NURSE TO ADJUST THE DOSAGE OF MEDICATION INCORRECTLY, LEADING TO POSSIBLE SERIOUS INJURY OR EVEN DEATH.OUR BIOMED DEPT IS UNABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE DAS PROBLEM WORKING WITH EITHER MANUFACTURER, PHILIPS AND MCKESSON.THE FOLLOWING IS FROM AN E-MAIL COMMUNICATION WITH PHILIPS SUPPORT:CUSTOMER HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY PHILIPS SYSTEM SENDS NIBP DATA VIA HL7 TO MCKESSON CHARTING SYSTEM.HE HAS A LARGE SERVER NETWORK WITH 5 DBS AND 1 PATIENT LINK WITH MPX MONITORS. THE MPX MONITORS ARE CONFIGURED FOR AUTO NIBP MEASUREMENTS EVERY 15 MINUTES. THE MCKESSON SYSTEM QUERIES THE DBS OR PL ONCE EVERY MINUTE, HOWEVER IT APPLIES A FILTER TO THE NIBP DATA SO THAT THE NURSES VIEW IT ON THE CHARTING SYSTEM ONLY IN 15 MINUTE INTERVALS.THE PROBLEM IS THE MPX  MONITOR STARTS THE NIBP CLOCK WHEN THE PUMP STARTS, BUT IT MAY SOMETIMES TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO TO ACTUALLY GET A READING (DUE TO PATIENT-RELATED OR APPLICATION ISSUES). DURING THAT TIME MCKESSON WOULD HAVE QUERIED FOR THE DATA AND RECEIVED IT BUT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPLAY IN THE NURSES 15 MINUTE VIEW BECAUSE OF THAT 1-2 MINUTE LAG.AS A WORKAROUND, THE CUSTOMER HAS DISABLED THE EXTERNAL TIME SOURCE AT THE MASTER DBS AND HAS MANUALLY OFFSET THE TIME 1-2 MINUTES AHEAD AT THE MASTER DBS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE TIME DISCREPANCY OF THE NIBP MEASUREMENTS.THE CUSTOMER IS SUGGESTING THAT THE MPX MONITOR BE MODIFIED SO THAT ONCE IT DETECTS AN ACTIVE HL7 CONNECTION, IT SHOULD START THE NIBP PUMP 1-2 MINUTES EARLIER SO THAT THE DATA IS NOT MISSED ON THE DISPLAY VIEW AT THE MCKESSON CHARTING SYSTEM.THE CUSTOMER HAS ALSO RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT OTHER NON-PHILIPS SITES THAT (ANOTHER) VENDOR'S MONITORS DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ALLOW YOU TO OFFSET THE NIBP START TIME A LITTLE BIT.
2087895	0	THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR MDR EVALUATION PROCESS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR MDR PROCESS TO BETTER ALIGN WITH CURRENT AGENCY POLICY. WE REGRET THAT THIS CHANGE HAS CAUSED THIS MDR TO BE FILED OUTSIDE THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME. CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT ABOUT 10 MINUTES INTO A TRIMA RUN, A MALE DONOR HAD COMPLAINED OF ARM DISCOMFORT. A SMALL BRUISE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER WAS OBSERVED AND THE PROCEDURE WAS DISCONTINUED. THERE WAS NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION BEYOND THE APPLICATION OF COLD COMPRESS. NO OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS TO THE DONOR FROM THIS INCIDENT. (B)(4). THE RDF'S (RUN DATA FILES) WERE ANALYZED FOR THE PROCEDURE AND SHOW THAT THE TRIMA OPERATED AS INTENDED. THE CUSTOMER'S BIOMED CHECKED THE MACHINE. CARIDIANBCT HAS NOT BEEN MADE AWARE OF THOSE RESULTS. THE DHR (DEVICE HISTORY RECORD) WAS REVIEWED AND NO ISSUES NOTED. IF THERE IS A VERY SLOW LEAK FROM THE VENIPUNCTURE SITE DURING A COLLECTION PROCEDURE, THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM MAY NOT DETECT THIS AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT TRIGGER THE RETURN PRESSURE ALARM. THIS SITUATION COULD BE CREATED OR EXACERBATED IF AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE NEEDLE IS MADE AFTER RECEIVING A RETURN PRESSURE HIGH ALARM. THE RETURN PRESSURE HIGH ALERT OCCURS WHEN THE RETURN PRESSURE REACHES +310 MM HG. THE OPERATOR DOES NEED TO MONITOR THE VENIPUNCTURE SITE AND THE DONOR DURING COLLECTION PROCEDURES TO BE SURE THEY ARE NOT HAVING ANY DISCOMFORT. ROOT CAUSE: DONOR ACCESS ISSUES. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE OPERATED AS INTENDED.
1486356	1	THE USER REPORTED THAT MONITOR HAD NO AUDIBLE SOUND. >< METHOD AND RESULTS: THERE WAS NO ADVERSE EVENT AND THERE WAS NO PT INVOLVED. THE USER CLAIMED THAT THEY REPLACED THE DEVICE'S SPEAKER, BUT THIS DID NOT RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. THE DEVICE MFR ADVISED THE USER THAT THE NO SOUND CONDITION WAS LIKELY BEING CAUSED BY THE DEVICE'S MOTHERBOARD. THE USER WAS ALSO ADVISED THAT THE DEVICE NEEDED TO RETURN TO THE MFR FOR FACTORY REPAIR BECAUSE THE MOTHERBOARD REQUIRES PROGRAMMING AND CANNOT BE REPLACED IN THE FILED. THE USER REPORTED TO THE DEVICE MFR THAT THEY HAVE REMOVED THE DEVICE FROM SERVICE AND THAT THE DEVICE WILL REMAIN OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL IT IS REPAIRED, TESTED, AND DEEMED FULLY OPERATIONAL. AT THIS TIME, NO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION OR ACTION IS WARRANTED OR POSSIBLE.
953966	0	A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BECKMAN COULTER REGARDING LOW HEMOGLOBIN (HGB), AND PLATELET (PLT) RESULTS THAT WERE GENERATED BY THE COULTER ACT DIFF INSTRUMENT. A PATIENT SAMPLE WAS TESTED FOR HGB AND PLT: HGB RESULT WAS 9.3 G/DL, AND PLT RESULT WAS 137 X 10 TO THE THIRD POWER CELLS/UL. BOTH RESULTS WERE PRINTED WITH AN OPERATOR DEFINED MESSAGES 'L' (L-LOW RESULT. FOR PATIENT SAMPLES, RESULT IS LOWER THAN THE LOW PATIENT SAMPLE LIMIT'). HGB AND PLT RESULTS WERE REPORTED OUT OF THE LAB AND THE PATIENT WAS SENT TO A HOSPITAL. UPON REDRAW AT THE HOSPITAL, HGB AND PLT RESULTS WERE 'NORMAL' AND THE PATIENT WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT TREATMENT. HOSPITAL PRINTOUT WAS NOT PROVIDED. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE DAY OF THE EVENT (2007), THE BATHS WERE NOT DRAINING PROPERLY. AFTER CORRECTING THE DRAIN ISSUE, THE CUSTOMER RERAN THE SAMPLE FOR HGB AND PLT AND THE REPEATED RESULTS WERE: 14.1 G/DL AND 169 X 10 TO THE THIRD POWER CELLS/UL RESPECTIVELY. THE REPEATED RESULTS CORRELATED WITH THE HOSPITAL RESULTS WHICH WERE CONSIDERED CORRECT. BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT OR USER. >< QC WAS RUN BEFORE AND AFTER CORRECTING THE BATH OVERFLOW ISSUE AND ALL LEVELS RECOVERED WITHIN EXPECTED RANGES. THE INSTRUMENT IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING WITHIN QC SPECIFICATIONS. PREVIOUSLY TESTED PATIENT SAMPLES WERE RERUN TO CONFIRM ACCURATE BACK TO THE LAST ACCEPTABLE QC RUN. THE SAMPLE WAS DRAWN IN A 4.0 ML VACUTAINER AND WAS STORED AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE FOR 15 MINUTES PRIOR TESTING. THE ERRONEOUS RESULTS OCCURRED IN AN OPEN VIAL WHOLE BLOOD MODE OF OPERATION AND CUSTOMER STATED THAT THIS WAS THE LAST SAMPLE TESTED IN 2007. BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION, CUSTOMER REPLACED THE PERISTALTIC PUMP TUBING ON THE WASTE PUMP AND CHECK VALVE IN THE DRAIN SYSTEM. THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE DRAINING, BUT THE SYSTEM GENERATED A VACUUM ERROR AND CUSTOMER REPLACED THE FLUID BARRIER AND ADJUSTED THE VACUUM. AFTER SERVICING THE INSTRUMENT, CUSTOMER PERFORMED A STARTUP AND QC AND OBTAINED ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. AS PER PRODUCT LABELING, WHEN ALL COUNTED PARAMETERS ARE CONSISTENTLY LOWER THAN NORMAL AND MCV IS NORMAL, THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FOLLOWING: SHORT SAMPLE, POOR BATH DRAIN, DILUTED SAMPLE. THE LOW RESULTS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A DILUTED SAMPLE CAUSED BY THE BATH NOT DRAINING PROPERLY. A MALFUNCTION WILL BE ASSUMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT.

2469311	0	THE PT WAS SEATED IN A CHAIR AND WAS BEING POSITIONED FOR A NEEDLE LOCALIZATION PROCEDURE. THE SELENIA C-ARM WAS LOWERED BY THE TECHNOLOGIST BY DEPRESSING THE FOOTSWITCH. WHEN THE FOOTSWITCH WAS RELEASED THE C-ARM CONTINUED THE DOWNWARD MOTION. THE TECHNOLOGIST DEPRESSED THE UP-COMMAND FOOTSWITCH, BUT THE C-ARM CONTINUED DOWNWARD ONTO THE PT'S LEFT LEG. THE SYSTEM WAS EVENTUALLY STOPPED VIA PHYSICAL RESISTANCE BY TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS CALLED TO ASSIST THE TECHNOLOGIST DURING THIS EVENT. THE EMERGENCY OFF SWITCH WAS NOT USED. THE TECHNOLOGIST STATED PT'S LEG HAD A RED MARK WHERE IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE SELENIA C-ARM. THE PT WAS BROUGHT TO ANOTHER ROOM AND THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED THAT SAME DAY. THE SELENIA SYSTEM WAS EVALUATED BY AN HOLOGIC FIELD ENGINEER ON (B)(4) 2012 AND WAS FOUND TO BE WORKING PROPERLY. THE TECHNOLOGIST STATED THE PT WAS VERY NERVOUS AND MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY DEPRESSED THE CONTROL SWITCH AT THE BACK OF THE SYSTEM C-ARM ALLOWING FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE DOWNWARD MOVEMENT. THE OPERATOR'S MANUAL ADVISES CAUTION IN THE PLACEMENT OF THE PT'S HANDS DURING A PROCEDURE TO AVOID THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF THE EMERGENCY OFF SWITCH WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN THE SYSTEM, PREVENTING THE CONTINUED DOWNWARD MOTION OF THE C-ARM. THE TECHNOLOGIST DID NOT USE THE EMERGENCY OFF SWITCH DURING THIS EVENT. THE SYSTEM WAS IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO SERVICE AFTER THE EVAL BY THE HOLOGIC FIELD ENGINEER. NO OTHER OCCURRENCES HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH THIS SYSTEM.

THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WHITE BLOOD CELL TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT # (B)(6). THE DISPOSABLE KIT WILL NOT BE RETURNED AS IT HAS BEEN DISCARDED. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RDF DID NOT FIND A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE INDICATE IT IS POSSIBLE, THOUGH NOT CONCLUSIVE, THAT THE PLASMA LINE MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OCCLUDED NEAR THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. IF THE PLASMA LINE DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE PROPERLY TO THE PLATELET PUMP, IT COULD CAUSE THE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTEM EXPECTS, POSSIBLY ALLOWING SOME WBCS TO ESCAPE.

1000791	0	THE CUSTOMER REMOVED THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY AND SAW NO EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE TO THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY OR THE ASPIRATION PROBE. THE CUSTOMER CYCLED POWER BUT THIS DID STOP FLUID FROM SHOOTING OUT OF THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY. THE CUSTOMER ALSO AUTOCLEANED 3 TIMES BUT THE INSTRUMENT STILL SPORADICALLY PRODUCED RESULTS OF ZERO AND SHORT SAMPLE ERRORS. A FIELD SERVICE REP (FSR) WAS DISPATCHED AND REPLACED THE MANIFOLD VALVE ASSEMBLY, CONTAINING 8 SOLENOID VALVES, BECAUSE THE RETIC REAGENT WAS NOT FILLING. THE FSR ALSO REPLACED, AS A PRECAUTION, A CIRCUIT BOARD, WHICH CONTROLS THE SOLENOID VALVES, AND A PRESSURE SENSOR IN THE ASPIRATION TUBING. THE VENT HEAD WAS VERIFIED TO BE ALIGNED PROPERLY. LABELING: THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL (08H10-01, REV D) IN SECTION 8, OUTLINES HAZARDS AND RESPONSES TO HAZARDS. PAGE 8-2 OUTLINES THE OPERATOR RESPONSIBILITY. PAGES 8-5 THROUGH 8-10 DISCUSSES BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL HAZARDS. THE OPERATOR SHOULD WEAR GLOVES, LAB COATS AND PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR WHEN HANDLING HUMAN-SOURCED MATERIALS, REAGENTS OR WORKING AROUND THE INSTRUMENT WHEN IT IS OPERATING. THE TEXT DOES NOT DESCRIBE HOW THE OPERATOR LOOKED INSIDE THE INSTRUMENT TO OBSERVE THE ACTION OF THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY. WHEN THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY IS ASPIRATING, IT IS NOT VISIBLE BECAUSE OF THE PROCESSOR COVER. THE PROCESSOR COVER IS LOCKED AND THE LOCKED STATUS INDICATOR IS ON WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS IN ACTIVE USE [OPEN OR CLOSED MODE]. THE PROCESSOR COVER IS NOT INTENDED TO BE REMOVED BY THE OPERATOR DURING ROUTINE OPERATION. WHEN THE COVER IS REMOVED DURING MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES, THE SYSTEM IS UNABLE TO PROCESS SAMPLES. (P 1-14) THE SENSOR OF THE PROCESSOR COVER HAS TO BE DELIBERATELY INACTIVATED FOR THE INSTRUMENT TO OPERATE WITHOUT THE PROCESSOR COVER. THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY CAN BE VIEWED, WHEN THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY HAS MOVED BACKWARDS AND IS DISPENSING BY OPENING THE RIGHT HAND DOOR. THE INSTRUMENT WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE WHILE THE DOOR IS OPEN BUT THE VIEWER CANNOT GET CLOSE TO THE VENT HEAD BECAUSE OF THE PROCESSOR COVER. PAGES 8-10, 8-11 CAUTIONS AGAINST OVERRIDING SAFETY DEVICES OR ALLOWING THE BODY TO ENTER THE REGION OF MOVEMENT WHILE THE INSTRUMENT IS OPERATING. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS FROM APRIL 2007 THROUGH JANUARY 2008 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ADVERSE TRENDS FOR THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. END OF REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY OF A CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE WAS SPORADICALLY SHOOTING FLUID INTO THE AIR WHILE RUNNING PT SAMPLES. THE CUSTOMER LOOKED INSIDE THE INSTRUMENT TO OBSERVE THE ACTION OF THE VENT HEAD ASSEMBLY. FLUID DID NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE CUSTOMER AND NO INJURY WAS REPORTED.

THE CARD TYPE IS IDENTIFIED BY A CARD CODE STAMPED ON THE SIDE OF THE CARD. AFTER 5 HOURS INCUBATION, THE CARD WAS INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED BY THE VITEK READER AS A GNS-114 SUSCEPTIBILITY CARD. AS A RESULT OF THE DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AND CONTENTS FOR THE TWO VITEK CARDS, TEN ANTIBIOTICS WERE ERRONEOUSLY ANALYZED. THIS MAY HAVE CAUSED FALSE SUSCEPTIBLE AND/OR FALSE RESISTANT RESULTS TO BE REPORTED. THE ERROR WAS DETECTED AND THE LAB NOTIFIED THE PHYSICIAN ABOUT THE PROBLEM ON THE SAME DAY PATIENT TREATMENT HAD NOT BEEN CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE POTENTIALLY INCORRECT LAB RESULTS. IT CONTINUED AS IT WAS PRIOR TO THE LAB TEST. THE LAB WAS DIRECTED TO CLEAN THE OPTICAL ARRAYS OF THE VITEK SYSTEM, TO RETURN THE REMAINING GNS-112 FROM LOT P96X FOR EVALUATION, AND TO NOTIFY US IF ANY ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS OCCURRED.><WE WERE UNABLE TO EVALUATE THE ORIGINAL GNS-112 TEST CARD BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN DISCARDED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE CUSTOMER DID RETURN ALL REMAINING GNS-112 CARDS FROM LOT P96X. THIRTY-EIGHT RETURNED CARDS WERE EVALUATED WITH THREE VISION SYSTEM CAMERAS AND NO PROBLEMS WERE DETECTED WITH THE CARD CODES. VISUALLY, THE CODES APPEARED TO BE GOOD AND WELL CENTERED. THE CARDS WERE ALSO EVALUATED WITH THREE VITEK SYSTEM READERS AND HAD NO FAILURES. THE CUSTOMER HAS REPORTED NO FURTHER PROBLEMS. BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT AND THE FACT THAT INITIALLY THE CARD WAS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED BY THE VITEK READER, WE SUSPECT THAT THE PRESENCE OF DUST ON THE OPTICAL ARRAYS OF THE VITEK READER IS THE PROBABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PROBLEM.

2087900	0	THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR MDR EVALUATION PROCESS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR MDR PROCESS TO BETTER ALIGN WITH CURRENT AGENCY POLICY. WE REGRET THAT THIS CHANGE HAS CAUSED THIS MDR TO BE FILED OUTSIDE THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME. DURING THE PROCEDURE, AGGREGATES WERE VISIBLE IN THE COLLECT LINE TO RESERVOIR AND AT THE FILTER IN THE RESERVOIR, AND WERE VISIBLE AT THE INTERFACE IN THE CENTRIFUGE IN THE FORM OF "WAVES". THE PROCEDURE, SPECTRA OPTIA LYMPHOCYTE COLLECTION, WAS 3X TBV (15L), AND WAS STOPPED PRIOR TO THE END OF THE PROCEDURE BECAUSE OF CRAMPS/TETANY OF HANDS AND FEET (THE PATIENT HAD CRAMPS/TETANY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCEDURE DUE TO A PREVIOUS PROCEDURE). DURING THE LYMPHOCYTE COLLECTION, TINGLING OCCURRED AROUND NOSE, MOUTH AND HANDS. CALCIUM GLUCONATE (3 X 2 ML AT 15 MINUTE INTERVALS) WAS ADMINISTERED WITH NO IMPROVEMENT. ON PRESCRIPTION OF APHAERESIS PHYSICIAN: ADMINISTRATION OF MAGNITOP AND CACIT ORAL, BECAUSE OF NO IMPROVEMENT WITH CALCIUM GLUCONATE. THE AGE OF THE PATIENT WAS NOT PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: A PREVIOUS STEM CELL COLLECTION PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED IN WHICH THE PATIENT BEGAN EXHIBITING CRAMPS/TETANY OF THE HANDS AND FEET FROM THE START OF THE PROCEDURE. THIS PATIENT REACTION INCREASED DURING THE SECOND PROCEDURE (LYMPHOCYTE COLLECTION CONDUCTED ON SPECTRA OPTIA) FORCING PROCEDURE CESSATION. AGGREGATES WERE VISIBLE IN THE COLLECT LINE DURING THE SECOND PROCEDURE. RUN DATA FILE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECTRA OPTIA LYMPHOCYTE COLLECTION PROCEDURE REVEALED NO ISSUES WITH THE EQUIPMENT. MANUFACTURING RECORD REVIEW: A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS WAS CONDUCTED BY THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATOR IN RELATION TO THIS FAILURE MODE. THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH THIS LOT. ROOT CAUSE: THE DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. PLATELET AGGREGATION AS DESCRIBED RESULTING IN VISIBLE AGGREGATES IS INDICATIVE OF UNDER-ANTICOAGULATED SPECTRA OPTIA SYSTEM. THE RECOMMENDED RESPONSE TO OBSERVANCE OF THIS BEHAVIOR IS TO AGGRESSIVELY DECREASE THE INLET: AC RADIO TO REDUCE THE SIZE AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF AGGREGATE FORMATION. THE PATIENT REACTION OF CRAMPS/TETANY OF THE HANDS AND FEET WAS EXPECTED TO SOME DEGREE DUE TO THE PRESCRIBED PRE-MEDICATION AND SIMILAR REACTION ON PREVIOUS STEM CELL COLLECTION PROCEDURE. CONCLUSION: UNDER-COAGULATION.
2162089	1	IT WAS REPORTED AFTER AN ABLATION PROCEDURE UTILIZING THE ENSITE VELOCITY SYSTEM FOR MAPPING THE CARDIAC MODEL, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED A PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. THE PHYSICIAN WAS ABLATING ON THE ROOF OF THE LEFT ATRIUM AND THE MITRAL ISTHMUS LINE WHEN IT WAS NOTED THE ABLATION CATHETER APPEARED TO BE 1 CM OR MORE OUTSIDE OF THE CARDIAC MODEL. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE ABLATION CATHETER. THE PHYSICIAN CONTINUED TO ABLATE USING FLUOROSCOPY TO CONFIRM THE PLACEMENT OF CATHETERS. THE ABLATION PROCEDURE HAD BEEN FINISHED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AND ALL DEVICES USED DURING THE PROCEDURE HAD BEEN REMOVED WHEN THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED AND AN EFFUSION WAS NOTED. THE PHYSICIAN TREATED THE CONDITION BY DRAINING THE EFFUSION 300 CC OF THE BLOOD FROM THE PERICARDIUM. AFTER THE EFFUSION, THE (B)(4) WAS REVIEWED ON THE ENSITE VELOCITY SYSTEM WHERE IT WAS DISCOVERED, THERE WERE TWO PERIODS DURING THE PROCEDURE WHERE THE CORONARY SINUS CATHETER HAD MOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL POSITION MARKED BY A CATHETER SHADOW PLACED ON THE ENSITE VELOCITY SYSTEM DISPLAY. THE PHYSICIAN HAD REISOLATED THE PULMONARY VEINS AND PERFORMED A RIGHT ISTHMUS ABLATION DURING THE PERIODS OF TIME WHERE THERE WAS POSITIONAL REFERENCE CATHETER MOVEMENT. THE CATHETER MOVEMENT WAS NOT DETECTED BY THE SYSTEM OPERATOR DURING THE PROCEDURE, AND THE POSITIONAL REFERENCE TOOL WAS NOT USED TO DETECT THE MOVEMENT. THE PATIENT RECOVERED FROM THE EFFUSION WITH NO FURTHER CONSEQUENCES AND WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL. THE INVESTIGATION MATERIALS HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED FOR ANALYSIS. UPON RECEIPT AND COMPLETION OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE, IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THAT REVIEW, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED.

4567462	0	A PATIENT UNDERGOING ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY (EGD) WITH THE NINEPOINT MEDICAL NVISIONVLE IMAGING SYSTEM AND WITH THE COVIDIEN BARRX RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION (RFA) SYSTEM. IMAGING WAS COMPLETED WITH A 20 MM NVISIONVLE OPTICAL PROBE. THE BALLOON ON THE OPTICAL PROBE WAS DEFLATED AND REMOVED FROM ENDOSCOPE WORKING CHANNEL. THE BARRX RFA SYSTEM WAS THEN INTRODUCED AND REMOVED FROM THE ENDOSCOPE WORKING CHANNEL AFTER THE RFA WAS COMPLETED. WHILE THE ENDOSCOPE WAS STILL IN PT, THE SAME 20 MM OPTICAL PROBE WAS REINTRODUCED THROUGH THE WORKING CHANNEL FOR POST RFA IMAGING. THE OPTICAL PROBE'S BALLOON WAS RE-INFLATED AND THE PT WAS THEN RE-IMAGED WITH THE NVISION IMAGING SYSTEM. THE TEAM THEN ATTEMPTED TO DEFLATE THE BALLOON FOR REMOVAL FROM THE ENDOSCOPE WORKING CHANNEL, HOWEVER THE BALLOON WOULD NOT DEFLATE. MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO DEFLATE THE BALLOON WERE MADE WITH NO RESULTS. THE CONNECTIONS ON NVISION INFLATION ACCESSORY WERE CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE SECURE. THE TEAM ALSO ATTEMPTED TO DEFLATE THE BALLOON WITH A 35 ML LUER-LOCK SYRINGE. AT THIS POINT, THE PHYSICIAN FELT THAT THE BALLOON HAD DEFLATED ENOUGH, AND WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL IT THROUGH THE ENDOSCOPE WORKING CHANNEL. HOWEVER, WHEN THE OPTICAL PROBE WAS REMOVED COMPLETELY FROM ENDOSCOPE CHANNEL, THE BALLOON WAS NOT ATTACHED TO OPTICAL PROBE. THE ENDOSCOPE WAS REINTRODUCED INTO PT AND THE BALLOON WAS OBSERVED IN ESOPHAGUS. A SNARE WAS INTRODUCED THROUGH ENDOSCOPE WORKING CHANNEL AND USED TO REMOVE THE BALLOON. THE BALLOON AND ENDOSCOPE WERE REMOVED FROM PATIENT AT SAME TIME. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS ON PT WERE NOTED BY THE PHYSICIAN.><THE INVESTIGATION OF THE RETURNED OPTICAL PROBE SHOWED THAT THE BALLOON COMPLETELY DETACHED FROM THE OPTICAL PROBE'S SHEATH AND THAT IT WAS STILL PARTIALLY INFLATED. FOUR MAJOR KINKS WERE NOTED ALONG THE OPTICAL PROBE SHEATH. THE INNER IMAGING LUMEN OF THE OPTICAL PROBE WAS STRETCHED DISTALLY, WHILE THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE OPTICAL PROBE WAS FOUND TO BE INTACT. THE DETACHED BALLOON WAS PRESSURIZED AND IT WAS UNABLE TO BE INFLATED NOR DEFLATED WITH A TOUHY BORST ADAPTER AND SYRINGE. THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE BALLOON SEPARATION FROM THE OPTICAL PROBE WAS THE ATTEMPT TO REMOVE IT THROUGH THE ENDOSCOPE WORKING CHANNEL WHILE IT WAS STILL PARTIALLY INFLATED. THE SHAFT OF THE OPTICAL PROBE WOULD MOVE FREELY IN THE ENDOSCOPE WORKING CHANNEL, BUT THE BALLOON WOULD BECOME STUCK AT THE WORKING CHANNEL OPENING DUE TO ITS PARTIALLY-INFLATED SIZE. THUS, CAUSING THE OPTICAL PROBE'S SHEATH TO BECOME STRETCHED AND THE BALLOON TO BECOME DETACHED FROM THE ASSEMBLY.

2069577	0	A PT WAS ANESTHETIZED FOR A LONG PROCEDURE USING THE GE ADVANCE ANESTHESIA DELIVERY SYSTEM. DURING THE COURSE OF THE ANESTHETIC, IT BECAME NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE SODA-SORB IN THE MACHINE BECAUSE THE ABSORBENT WAS EXHAUSTED, EVIDENCED BY THE PT REBREATHING HIGHER LEVELS OF CO2. IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING THE CANNISTER TO A FRESH ONE, AN O-RING BECAME DISLODGED FROM THE DEVICE. THIS WAS NOT RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THE OPERATING ROOM WAS DARK FOR THE PROCEDURE, AND THE O-RING IS VERY SMALL. WHEN THE CANNISTER WAS REPLACED INTO THE SYSTEM, AND THE O-RING WAS NOT ON THE DEVICE, THE MACHINE LOST ITS SEAL AND WE WERE UNABLE TO VENTILATE THE PT. IT WAS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT NO ONE KNEW THERE WAS AN O-RING ON THE CANNISTER THAT COULD BE DISLODGED AND ALSO THAT GE DID NOT SUPPLY ANY ADDITIONAL O-RINGS TO REPLACE ONE IF IT COMES OFF. WE HAD TO STOP THE SURGERY, VENTILATE THE PT WITH AN AMBU BAG WHILE STAFF WERE CRAWLING AROUND ON THE FLOOR TO FIND THE O-RING. WHEN IT WAS LOCATED, WE REPLACED IT (AFTER HAVING TO FIND EXACTLY WHERE IT HAD BEEN DISLODGED), AND THE PROCEDURE CONTINUED WITHOUT EVENT. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED HARM BY NOT BEING ABLE TO VENTILATE THE PT.

THE SAME PATIENT SAMPLE HAS TESTED IN THE MANUAL GEL METHOD AND FOUND TO BE RH POSITIVE (2+). THIS ISSUE IS OCCURRING ON BOTH PROVUES AT THIS FACILITY. BOTH PROVUES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE. CUSTOMER REFUSES TO TEST PATIENT SAMPLES ON THE INSTRUMENTS UNTIL A FIELD ENGINEER PERFORMS DIAGNOSTIC CHECKS. ISSUE STARTED ON: (B)(6) 2013. FREQUENCY: 1 SAMPLE; SAMPLE ID: NOT PROVIDED; MICROTUBES/WELLS OR CELL (DONOR #) AFFECTED: ANTI-D; METHODOLOGY USED: PROVUE; INCUBATION TIME (FOR MANUAL TEST ONLY): N/A; ERROR CODE: NO ERRORS DURING ANY TESTING; REACTION GRADE OBTAINED: NEGATIVE; CUSTOMER WAS EXPECTING: POSITIVE; TEST REPEATED: YES. BOTH PROVUES INITIALLY GAVE NEGATIVE RESULTS IN THE D MICROWELL. PROVUE# (B)(4) GAVE A 1+ POSITIVE UPON RETEST. THE SAMPLE WAS NOT RETESTED ON PROVUE (B)(4). MANUAL GEL TESTING USING THE SAME LOT OF GEL CARDS WAS DONE TWICE AND PRODUCED A 2+ AND 3+. TUBE METHOD AT IMMEDIATE SPIN GAVE A 3+ REACTION USING IMMUCOR ANTI-D LOT 506132 EXP 9-25-14. METHOD USED TO REPEAT: PROVUE AND TUBE. OTHER RELEVANT DETAILS: PATIENT IS A PREGNANT FEMALE, TYPED AS GROUP B AND DETERMINED TO BE RH POSITIVE WITH D.O.B. (B)(6). PATIENT WAS NOT TRANSFUSED WITH IN A YEAR. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS KNOWN. NO ERRONEOUS RESULTS WERE REPORTED. NO TRANSFUSIONS WERE GIVEN. CUSTOMER IS NOT CONFIDENT THE PROVUE IS OPERATING AS EXPECTED, ALTHOUGH THE QC TESTING (DONE WITH PATIENT SAMPLES) PASSED. CUSTOMER IS CONCERNED THE PROVUE MISSED VERY WEAKLY POSITIVE REACTIONS WITH THE ABD/REVERSE GEL CARD AND FEARS THE SAME MAY HAPPEN WITH ANTIBODY SCREENS. CUSTOMER FEELS THAT THE RESULT THAT WAS REPORTED AS NEGATIVE BY THE PROVUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE, OR AT LEAST FLAGGED BY THE PROVUE FOR REVIEW. THE TIF IMAGE PRODUCED BY THE PROVUE SHOWING SMALL AGGLUTINATION WAS SCANNED AND EMAILED TO CTS BY THE CUSTOMER. THIS IMAGE WAS CALLED NEGATIVE BY THE PROVUE. THIS CUSTOMER DEMANDED SERVICE WITHOUT PRIOR TROUBLESHOOTING. A SERVICE ORDER WAS CREATED AND AN FE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE CUSTOMER SITE. CUSTOMER STATES BOTH PROVUES AT THIS FACILITY MADE INCORRECT INTERPRETATIONS IN REPORTING THE REACTIONS IN THE ANTI-D MICROTUBES AS NEGATIVE SINCE SMALL AGGLUTINATION IS VISIBLE. CUSTOMER EMAILED THE FILE TO CTS. CUSTOMER STATES ONE IMAGE WAS OBTAINED FOR EACH PROVUE. INITIAL REPORT SENT WITH MFG # 2250051 INSTEAD OF MFG #1056600. THIS REPORT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SENT USING MFG # 2250051. FILE WILL BE RESUBMITTED UNDER THE CORRECT MFG NUMBER.><THE ROOT CAUSE THAT LED TO THIS EVENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE INFORMATION REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE FE RESPONDED TO THE SITE AND VERIFIED THAT THE INSTRUMENT IS PERFORMING TO SPECIFICATIONS. QUALITY CONTROL TESTING BEFORE AND AFTER THE SERVICE CALL PASSED. THERE WAS NO REPORTED HARM TO ANY PATIENTS. (B)(4).
1611605	0	(B)(4). RESULTS: PRODUCT MEETS RELIABILITY DATA. ABBOTT LABORATORIES RECEIVED AN INITIAL CUSTOMER COMPLAINT ALLEGING THE CELL-DYN INSTRUMENT DID NOT SIGNAL A WASTE FULL ALARM. ALTHOUGH THE ORIGINAL PART FOR THIS EVENT COULD NOT BE INVESTIGATED, THE INVESTIGATION OF THE REPORTED ISSUE DETERMINED THAT THE PART WAS IN USE GREATER THAN 2 YEARS. THE INVESTIGATION INTO RETURNED PARTS FROM THE FIELD SHOWED THAT ALL HAVE BEEN IN USE GREATER THAN 2 YEARS. IN-HOUSE INVESTIGATION OF THE RETURNED PARTS COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INITIAL COMPLAINT. THERE EXISTS A POTENTIAL FOR THE WASTE CONTAINER TO OVERFLOW WITH LIQUID WASTE WHEN THE WASTE SENSOR FAILS AT THE END OF ITS LIFE CYCLE. BASED ON THE INTENDED USE, THIS PART WILL WEAR OUT AND NEED PERIODIC REPLACEMENT AS IT IS IN CONTACT WITH BIOHAZARD MATERIAL AND CUSTOMER USAGE/HANDLING. IT CAN BE USED ON MULTIPLE CELL-DYN INSTRUMENT MODELS. NO PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE WAS IN PLACE. A REVIEW OF THE CELL-DYN SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL SHOWED ADEQUATE COVERAGE OF BIOHAZARD EXPOSURE AND WASTE OVERFLOW AS WELL AS TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION FOR POTENTIAL CAUSES. THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY IS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED. THE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY ISSUES WERE DETERMINED TO BE WITHIN ESTABLISHED FREQUENCY. A HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT (HHA) DETERMINED A LOW HEALTH RISK, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RISK MANAGEMENT FILE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCT ALTHOUGH, THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY MEETS THE RELIABILITY REQUIREMENT, THERE EXIST A POTENTIAL FOR THE WASTE CONTAINER TO OVERFLOW WITH LIQUID WASTE IF THE PRODUCT FAILS AT THE END OF ITS LIFE EXPECTANCY. THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY PART LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 2 YEARS IS NOT CURRENTLY IN OUR PRODUCT LABELING. THE PREVENTIVE ACTION WILL INVOLVE A LABEL CHANGE FOR THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY. WE ARE CHANGING OUR LABELING TO HAVE A PART REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE OF 6 MONTHS SO PARTS ARE REPLACED PRIOR TO THE END OF THE 2-YEAR LIFE FAILURE. THIS WILL HELP PREVENT OVERFLOW ISSUES CAUSED BY END OF LIFE PART FAILURE. A TAG THAT CAN BE AFFIXED TO THESE ITEMS WAS SENT WITH CUSTOMER LETTER. THIS TAG INCLUDES FIELDS TO RECORD INSTALLATION AND REPLACEMENT DATES. TAGS WILL ALSO BE INTRODUCED INTO REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLIES. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. >< AFTER RECEIVING THE CUSTOMER LETTER OF FA30NOV2009, THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE CELL-DYN WASTE SENSOR HAS BEEN FAILING TO DEMONSTRATE THE ALARM OF A FULL WASTE. THE CUSTOMER ORDERED A REPLACEMENT OF THE WASTE LINE ASSEMBLY SINCE THE ONE THEY HAVE IS FIVE YEARS OLD. NO EXPOSURE OR INJURIES WERE REPORTED. NO IMPACT TO USER SAFETY OR PATIENT RESULTS WAS REPORTED.
1927950	0	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE PT WAS TREATED WITH 8 FIELD IMRT PLAN. THE PT HAS 5 FIELDS AT 180 COUCH ROTATION AND 3 FIELDS WITH 90 COUCH ROTATION. SET-UP PT AND CLICK ACQUIRE PRIOR TO EVERY TREATMENT TO ENSURE COUCH PARAMETERS ARE THE SAME BY KV-KV IMAGE AND PERFORM 2D/2D MATCH. WHEN THEY ACQUIRED, THE THERAPIST CLICK "SELECT ALL" - AND ACQUIRED COUCH ROTATION ACCIDENTLY. ACKNOWLEDGED WARNING PLAN PARAMETER HAD CHANGED. THIS MODIFIED THE PLANNED COUCH ROTATION FOR ALL FIELDS TO 180 WHEN 3 WERE ACTUALLY PLANNED AT 90 - PERFORMED ONLINE MATCH APPLIED SHIFTS. THE FIRST FIELD THAT HAD A COUCH ROTATION OF 90 DEGREES WAS TREATED WITH COUCH ROTATION OF 0 FOR 28 MU OUT OF 95 MU FOR THAT FIELD. THERAPIST STOPPED BEAM AND ROTATED COUCH ROTATION TO 90 DELIVERED REMAINDER OF TREATMENT. REMAINDER OF FIELD TREATED CORRECTLY: RIGHTS IN TREATMENT ADMINISTRATION; PLAN EDIT PREFERENCES DO NOT ALLOW EDITING AND ACQUIRING ON APPROVED PLANS. IN THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN, THE MISADMINISTRATION WAS NOT CONSIDERED A SERIOUS INJURY. PT HAD 8 FIELD TREATMENT-. ONE OF THE FIELDS WAS PARTIALLY TREATED WITH COUCH AT WRONG ROTATION FOR 28 OF 90 MU. THIS RESULTED IN 8CGY BEING DELIVERED TO ORBIT AND BRAIN STEM. THIS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CAUSE INJURY. THE ISSUE AS REPORTED INVOLVES THE PLAN EDIT PREFERENCE SETTINGS DURING KV, KV IMAGING, AND THE USER EXPECTS THE PLAN EDIT PREFERENCE TO NOT BE OVERRIDDEN BY INDIVIDUAL USER RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH, THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL REPORT INDICATED NO SERIOUS INJURY IN THIS CASE, THE REPORTED ISSUE COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY IF THE CAPTURED SETTINGS WERE USED FOR TREATMENT ON MULTIPLE FRACTIONS. THOUGH STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, VARIAN HAS DETERMINED THAT AN MDR IS APPROPRIATE, AS THIS MALFUNCTION, SHOULD IT RECUR, COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE A SERIOUS INJURY. ADD'L F/U TO THIS MDR IS EXPECTED UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION.
2873815	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE TRIPLE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(6). THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS (DHR) WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS EVENT. THERE WERE NO EVENTS NOTED IN THE DHR THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. ROOT CAUSE: THIS DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE REMAINS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES WERE PROVIDED IN THE INITIAL REPORT FOR THIS EVENT. INTERNAL CAPAS HAVE BEEN INITIATED TO EVALUATE REPORTS OF ELEVATED WBC COUNTS.><(B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE INDICATE THAT THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT WAS LIKELY A RESULT OF AN ESCAPE OF WBCS FROM THE LRS CHAMBER DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE INDICATE IT IS POSSIBLE, THOUGH NOT CONCLUSIVE, THAT THE PLASMA LINE MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OCCLUDED DURING A PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE. IF THE PLASMA LINE DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE PROPERLY TO THE PLATELET PUMP, IT COULD CAUSE THE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTEM EXPECTS, POSSIBLY ALLOWING SOME WBCS TO ESCAPE. ORIENTATION OF THE HEX IN THE HEX HOLDER MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ABOVE. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.

1938391	0	THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT A PATIENT HAS CONSISTENTLY GENERATED LOW SODIUM ASSAY RESULTS ON SERUM SAMPLES TESTED ON THE ARCHITECT C8000 ANALYZER. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS PATIENT: FROM (B)(6) 2010 THROUGH (B)(6) 2010, THIS DIABETIC, POST-RENAL TRANSPLANT PATIENT BEING WEANED OFF OF STEROIDS, HAS GENERATED SODIUM RESULTS RANGING FROM 123 TO 127 MMOL/L. THE LAB'S NORMAL REFERENCE RANGE IS 130 TO 149 MMOL/L. THE PATIENT'S MOST RECENT SAMPLE (LIPEMIC; CHOLESTEROL = 220 MG/DL AND TRIGLYCERIDES = 238 MG/DL) WAS SENT TO A REFERENCE LAB WHERE A SODIUM RESULT OF 143 MMOL/L WAS GENERATED (REFERENCE LAB NORMAL RANGE IS 135 TO 145 MMOL/L). THE PATIENT'S DOCTOR HAD THIS PATIENT HOSPITALIZED BECAUSE OF THE LOW SODIUM RESULTS AND INCREASED THE PATIENT'S STEROID THERAPY, TO WHICH NO RESPONSE WAS NOTED. TESTING AT THE HOSPITAL LAB GENERATED A SODIUM RESULT OF 142 MMOL/L, WHICH IS WITHIN THE NORMAL REFERENCE RANGE USED BY THE HOSPITAL. CONTROLS HAVE REMAINED WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS AT ALL TIMES AND A PRECISION RUN PERFORMED BY THE CUSTOMER MET ALL ASSAY PACKAGE INSERT SPECIFICATIONS. THERE ARE NO SIMILAR ISSUES WITH ANY OTHER PATIENTS' SAMPLES. THE CUSTOMER HAS REQUESTED A SERVICE CALL. THERE IS NO FURTHER IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED. (B)(4). AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.><(B)(4). AN ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) VISITED THE CUSTOMER SITE AND PERFORMED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER REPLACED THE INTEGRATED CHIP TECHNOLOGY (ICT) MODULE THAT SAMPLES GENERATED EXPECTED RESULTS. SUBSEQUENT INSTRUMENT OPERATIONS AND TEST RESULTS WERE ACCEPTABLE. THE EVALUATION BEGAN WITH A REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMER'S SODIUM QUALITY CONTROL RANGES IN USE: LEVEL 1 = 98 - 114 MMOL/L AND LEVEL 2 = 124 - 151 MMOL/L. THESE RANGES ARE BASED ON THE CONTROL MANUFACTURER'S UNITY REPORT AND ARE TOO LARGE TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR SODIUM PERFORMANCE. ABBOTT CUSTOMER SUPPORT RECOMMENDED THEY ESTABLISH CONTROL RANGES BASED ON THEIR OWN DATA. THE CUSTOMER MAY HAVE BEEN ALERTED TO SODIUM RESULTS BEING DEPRESSED IF THEIR CONTROL RANGES HAD BEEN MORE SUITABLE. THE CUSTOMER RETURNED THE SUSPECT ICT MODULE AND THREE PATIENT SAMPLES. TESTING WITH THESE RETURNED MATERIALS VERIFIED THE ISSUE SEEN AT THE CUSTOMER SITE. THE DATA SUPPORTS THAT THE SODIUM MEMBRANE OF THE RETURNED ICT MODULE WAS CONTAMINATED. QUALITY CONTROL RESULTS WERE NOT AS DEPRESSED AS THE SAMPLE RESULTS, WHICH INDICATES THESE SPECIFIC PATIENT SAMPLES ALSO CONTAIN AN INTERFERENT / CONTAMINATE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ISSUE. THE ICT MODULE BLEACHING PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED ICT MODULE, AFTER WHICH THE SAMPLE SODIUM RESULTS INCREASED BY 7 - 9 MMOL/L AND CONTROL RESULTS INCREASED BY 2 MMOL/L. A SINGLE BLEACHING APPEARS TO HAVE REMOVED SOME, BUT NOT ALL OF THE CONTAMINATION. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING METRICS WAS PERFORMED AND IDENTIFIED NO ADVERSE TRENDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPLAINT ISSUE CURRENTLY UNDER EVALUATION. THE ICT SAMPLE DILUENT PACKAGE INSERT ((B)(4), (B)(4) 2009) AND THE ARCHITECT SYSTEMS OPERATIONS MANUAL ((B)(4), (B)(4) 2010) CONTAIN INFORMATION TO ADDRESS THE CUSTOMER'S CURRENT ISSUE. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, A SPECIFIC CAUSE FOR THE DISCREPANT LOW SODIUM RESULTS BEING GENERATED BY SPECIFIC PATIENT SAMPLES WAS NOT IDENTIFIED. PROBABLE CAUSES INCLUDE SODIUM MEMBRANE EXPOSURE AND/OR CONTAMINATION OVER TIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH UNKNOWN SAMPLE FACTORS. THE CUSTOMER'S ICT MODULE HAD BEEN IN USE FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS AND UP TO 12,000 SAMPLES, WHICH PROVIDES AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONTAMINATION. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE ICT MODULE WAS BLEACHED TO REMOVE CONTAMINATION. IT APPEARS THAT SAMPLES FROM PARTICULAR PATIENTS MAY INCLUDE SPECIFIC FACTORS (INTERFERENTS/CONTAMINANTS) THAT AFFECT SOME SODIUM MEMBRANES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO UNKNOWN CONTAMINATES OVER TIME. METHOD: REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING; FIELD SERVICE INTERVENTION.

4200514	0	INVESTIGATION: TWO TRIMA ACCEL SETS WERE RECEIVED FOR INVESTIGATION. EACH KIT WAS LEAK TESTED AND A LEAK WAS FOUND AT THE CONTROL Y CONNECTOR OF EACH SET. SPECIFICALLY, THE LEAK SOURCE WAS AT THE KNIT LINE OF THE RBC PORT OF THE CONTROL Y. THE CUSTOMER ALSO SENT PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF THE BLOOD SPRAY CONFIRMING THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) FOR THIS UNIT SHOWED NO IRREGULARITIES DURING MANUFACTURING THAT WERE RELEVANT TO THIS ISSUE. ROOT CAUSE: THE LEAK IN THE CONTROL Y PARTS IS DUE TO A LEAK PATH AT THE KNIT LINE AND IS LOCATED ON THE FIRST SHOULDER OF THE CONTROL Y NEAR THE RBC PORT. THE KNIT LINE IS CREATED AS A NORMAL PART OF THE MOLDING PROCESS. IN THIS CASE, THE INJECTION PROCESS WAS SHUT OFF PREMATURELY AND THE MATERIAL DID NOT COMPLETELY FILL ALONG THE KNIT LINE AND A VOID OR GAP RESULTED. DURING CENTRIFUGATE THE CONTROL Y IS SUBJECT TO HIGH INTERNAL PRESSURE AND AN OPENING CAN FORM ALONG THE KNIT LINE WHICH CAN ALLOW FOR A LEAK PATH. THIS TYPE OF LEAK IS A VERY FINE SPRAY WHICH MAY NOT SIGNAL THE CENTRIFUGE'S LEAK DETECTOR TO ALARM. CORRECTIVE ACTION: THE ROOT CAUSE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AND AN IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT THE SUPPLIER. THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM TIME ALLOWED FOR FILLING OF THE MOLD TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE RESIN INJECTION TIME. THIS ALLOWS FOR A COMPLETE KNIT LINE OF THE PART.><THIS RECORD WAS IDENTIFIED DURING A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF MDRS TO IDENTIFY RECORDS IN WHICH AN EVENT OCCURRED, BUT THE TYPE OF REPORTABLE EVENT WAS NOT INDICATED.><THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THEY EXPERIENCED A LEAK ON 2 DISPOSABLE SETS.

3865731	1	DURING A CARDIAC CATH PROCEDURE, TECH WAS ASKED TO RECORD A PULLBACK ON THE PHILLIPS XPER RECORDING SYSTEM. TECH PERFORMED THE NORMAL STEPS TO RECORD THE PULLBACK BUT WHEN SHE WAS ASKED TO LABEL A CHAMBER IN THE HEART ON THE SYSTEM, THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO RECORD THE PULLBACK ON THE XPER SYSTEM IN CATH LAB #2. AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO STOP THE RECORDING, THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT STOP RECORDING AND THE GREEN LIGHT WOULD NOT TURN OFF. THE SYSTEM WAS THEN RESTARTED WITHOUT SUCCESS. THE DECISION WAS MADE TO DO A TOTAL REBOOT. THE PATIENT WAS BEING MONITORED BY THE ANESTHESIA TEAM DURING THE ENTIRE CARDIAC CATH PROCEDURE. AFTER REBOOTING THE SYSTEM, THE PRIOR PULLBACK RECORDING WAS LOST AND HAD TO BE REPEATED. THE TOTAL DELAY IN THE CASE WAS 10 MINUTES.
5982027	1	the customer contacted a siemens technical service center (tsc) specialist. tsc reviewed the data provided. the tsc found that the centralink data management system omitted a test. tsc verified the centralink configuration and no errors were found. tsc modified the frequency of the omit_command_2 task from every one minute to every five minutes. a siemens headquarters support center (hsc) specialist reviewed the data supplied. hsc stated the system was configured correctly. all hold tests were setup for both vista instruments as per the vista with aliquot support documentation. hsc stated that the hold tests were reflexed appropriately by the sample tube re-run button. hsc found that the hold tests were omitted by centralink before the customer had the ability to setup the vancomycin test for a manual re-run. hsc was able to duplicate the event. the cause of the discordant, vancomycin results was due to centralink running a batch command to omit the hold tests". the instrument is performing according to specifications. no further evaluation of the device is required.><discordant vancomycin results were obtained on two dimension vista instruments that were linked to a centralink data management system. the customer initially received an above assay range result on their dimension vista 2 instrument (>50). the customer followed proper protocol to repeat the sample using a "sample tube rerun". the customer then performed a manual 1:6 dilution and set the sample to run in centralink. the customer then manually programmed the sample to run on their dimension vista 1 instrument. a falsely elevated result of >250 obtained from dimension vista 2 populated the current result column in centralink  followed by a falsely low result of 9.8 obtained from dimension vista 1. the depressed result (9.8) was not released to the physician(s)  as the operator who performed the dilution knew the result should be higher. it is unknown if a result was released to the physician(s). it was determined that the "hold" tests function was properly triggered when the customer used the "sample tube rerun". however  the "hold" tests were omitted by a "batch" (not by user) function/mode. because the "hold" tests were omitted  centralink sent the order again to dimension vista 2 instrument  which caused the result to be run neat. when the repeat result from the dimension vista 2 instrument transmitted to centralink as >50  a dilution factor of 6 was applied on a neat sample  thus obtaining an elevated result of >250. minutes later  the low result of 9.8 was received from dimension vista 1  but the dilution factor had already been applied to the result of >50  thus obtaining a falsely low result. there are no reports of patient intervention or adverse health consequences due to the discordant results."

THE PCO2 RESULT FROM THE ANALYZER WAS 126.6 MMHG AND THE RESULT IN THE DATACARE SYSTEM WAS 1269.6 MMHG. THIS RESULT WAS PASSED ON TO THE LIS. THE PATIENT WAS TREATED FROM THE PRINTED OFF RESULT FROM THE ANALYZER WHICH WAS THE CORRECT RESULT AND WAS NOT TREATED FROM INFORMATION IN THE DATACARE. THE PATIENT EXPIRED, BUT THE USER STATED THERE WAS NO DELAY IN TREATMENT RELATED TO THE RESULTS. THE PATIENT WAS NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE EVENT. THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT SPECIALIST INSTRUCTED THE USER TO RESEND THE RESULT FROM THE ANALYZER TO DATACARE AND THE RESULT WAS SENT CORRECTLY. A ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED. THE EVENT COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED AND HAS NOT OCCURRED SINCE THE ORIGINAL EVENT. THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ERROR LOG PROVIDED FOR INVESTIGATION THAT DEMONSTRATES THIS EVENT. CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE ANALYZER (OMNI SN (B)(4)) GENERATED A PCO2 RESULT OF 126.6 MMHG AND THE RESULT WENT TO DATACARE WHERE DATACARE INDICATED THE SAME RESULT WAS 126.6 MMHG WITH GENERIC DEMOGRAPHICS. AT THE TIME THE SAMPLE WAS RUN, THE PATIENT IDENTIFICATION WAS UNKNOWN SO THE CUSTOMER USED A GENERIC ID NUMBER OF (B)(4). THIS CAUSED THE SAMPLE TO BE HELD IN THE DATACARE QUEUE FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS UNTIL THE CUSTOMER ENTERED THE PROPER ID (DEMOGRAPHICS). WHEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS ENTERED BY THE CUSTOMER WERE THEN CHANGED TO THE PROPER PATIENT IDENTIFICATION AT DATACARE THAT IS WHEN THE RESULT OF 1269.6 MMHG WAS PASSED ON TO THE HOSPITAL (B)(6). THE PATIENT WAS NOT TREATED WITH THE INCORRECT RESULT THAT WAS ON THE DATACARE OR CUSTOMER LIS SYSTEM, THE PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH THE ANALYZER PRINTOUT WHICH WAS CORRECT.

"if the acid-fast smear is positive  proceed with the mycobacteria specific identification procedures employed by your institution. if the concentrated smear is negative for acid-fast bacilli  a gram stain should be performed. if both the acid-fast smear and the gram stain are negative  indicating a possible false positive  the bottle should be loaded back into the instrument until growth of subculture or redesignation as positive or negative. cultures which were initially determined false positive and were redesignated positive  should be smeared and subcultured." as the customer followed the package insert which directs all bottles designated positive to be smeared and subcultured  there was no patient impact. it has been determined that this issue  should it reoccur  will not likely lead to death or serious adverse event as the package insert clearly defines the test procedure for bottles that screen positive.><a customer in the (b)(6) notified biom?rieux of false positive results associated with the bact/alert? mp culture bottles. the customer reported the samples  mostly sputum  pleural fluid and bronchial washes  are broken down with mucolyse for 15 minutes. then the samples are decontaminated with naoh 4%  vortex mixed for 20-30 seconds every five (5) minutes for 30 minutes  mixed with a phosphate buffer (checked with a ph color indictor in the neutralization buffer)  centrifuged on 3000g for 15 minutes and then inoculated with mas into mp bottles. the customer indicated that when the bottles signal positive  they get a zn stain  which indicates no growth. the bottles are then reloaded into the bact/alert instrument. the customer reported there has been no patient impact and incorrect results were not reported to the wards; however  a delay in processing may have occurred with some samples due to this issue. an internal biom?rieux investigation will be initiated."

6071752	0	leica biosystems received a complaint that tissue in 45 cassettes, which had been processed overnight on friday through to saturday in retort a and b, was very burnt" and dehydrated. the complainant advised that the reagent in each of two (2) bottles was replaced with either 70% alcohol and 90% alcohol on saturday; the quality of tissue processing from a validation run comprising a single block  which was performed following replacement of the reagent in the two (2) bottles  was satisfactory and a power outage in the building "later on saturday" necessitated re-start of the instrument as the ups was unable to support the instrument for the duration of the power outage. on 15 september 2016  leica biosystems received information that tissue samples exhibiting sub-optimal processing would be un-diagnosable. the number of undiagnosable samples was not provided. on 06 october 2016  leica biosystems received further information that seven (7) cases were un-diagnosable and would require re-biopsy. an identifier  the age and the gender for each patient requiring re-biopsy was provided.

THE MANUFACTURER REVIEWED THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD, QA TEST DATA, AND RISK ANALYSIS, COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THE MODEL NUMBER AND SIMILAR MODELS. REVIEW OF THE QA INSPECTION RESULT OF THE UNIT SHOWED THE UNIT HAD NO PROBLEM. THERE WAS NO SIMILAR CASE REPORTED IN THE PAST. THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER PERFORMED AN INVESTIGATION BY EVALUATING RETAINED SAMPLES. THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER EXAMINED THE IGNITION CAPABILITY OF AC ADAPTER FOR FOLLOWING EVENTS: COMPONENT ON SUBSTRATE OR CORD CAUGHT FIRE DUE TO OVERLOAD TO AC ADAPTER; LIGHTING SURGE BROKE INNER COMPONENT AND IT CAUGHT FIRE; IGNITED DUE TO TRACKING PHENOMENON. AS FOR 1, PUT CURRENT LOAD OF 650- 700MA JUST BEFORE VOLTAGE SUPPLY IS SHUT DOWN AT PROTECTION CIRCUIT AND CHECKED TEMPERATURE INCREASE DURING OPERATION OF FOR 30 MINUTES. RECTIFIER DIODE WITH HIGHEST TEMPERATURE ELEVATION WAS SATURATED AT ABOUT 80 DEGREES AND IT WAS NOT LED TO BURNOUT OR IGNITION. (RATING OF THIS AC ADAPTER: 500MA, MAXIMUM LOAD AT ORDINARY USE: 300MA) APPLIED 5A OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT TO AC ADAPTER CORD AND CHECKED TEMPERATURE INCREASE, FOUND THAT IT WAS SATURATED AT ABOUT 60.7 DEGREES, MELT OR IGNITION DID NOT OCCUR. THEREFORE, IT'S JUDGED THAT NO IGNITION HAPPENED DUE TO EVENT 1. AS FOR 2, BROKE AC ADAPTER WITH LIGHTING SURGE, CHECKED SUBSTRATE AND FOUND OUT OPEN FAILURE OF FUSE AND ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR WITHOUT BURNOUT. THEREFORE, IT IS JUDGED THAT NO IGNITION HAPPEN DUE TO THE EVENT 2. AS FOR 3, THERE IS NO DESIGN PROBLEM ABOUT TRACKING RESISTANCE SINCE THIS AC ADAPTER IS UL-APPROVED. THEREFORE, IT IS JUDGED THAT IS HAS A LOW POTENTIAL FOR IGNITION DUE TO EVENT 3. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE RETAINED SAMPLES; CONCLUDED THAT RISK ANALYSIS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING 2 POINTS: NO BURNOUT OR IGNITION OF AC ADAPTER WAS FOUND AT ABOVE LIGHTING SURGE TEST; FROM THE TEST RESULT, WHEN HIGH VOLTAGE APPLIED TO BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR UNIT (BPM) BURNOUT OF REGULATOR OCCURS AND BPM STOPS OPERATION.

IN THE LETTER, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE INSURED SUSTAINED SEVERE DAMAGES TO THEIR HOME AS A RESULT OF THE FIRE. THE ENGINEER THAT WAS CALLED IN TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF FIRE IDENTIFIED THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE AS BEING THE OMRON BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WHICH WAS THE ONLY ITEM PLUGGED INTO THE ELECTRICAL OUTLET IN THE MASTER BEDROOM IN THE AREA OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE. THE ENGINEER CONCLUDED: BASED UPON OUR INVESTIGATION TO DATE, WE HAVE FORMED THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS: THE AREA OF FIRE ORIGIN WAS AT THE OMRON BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR LOCATED IN THE AREA OF FIRE ORIGIN. THE PROBABLE SOURCE OF HEAT FOR IGNITION WAS AN ELECTRICAL FAILURE OF THE POWER CORD FOR THE OMRON BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR. ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION IS SUGGESTED TO VERIFY. THE PROBABLE FIRST FUEL IGNITED WAS THE POWER CORD INSULATION AND COMBUSTIBLES ON THE WOODEN DESK INCLUDING PAPER/DOCUMENTS. THE FIRE IS CLASSIFIED AS ACCIDENTAL AT THIS TIME BASED ON THE REMAINING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND REPORTED INFORMATION. NO OTHER COMPETENT SOURCES OF HEAT FOR IGNITION WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE AREA OF FIRE ORIGIN. ADDITIONAL DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION OF THE UNIT IS AN OPTION AT YOUR DISCRETION AFTER THE MANUFACTURER IS PLACED ON NOTICE. AT THIS TIME, OUR CLAIM IS STILL ONGOING. ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE (B)(6) REPRESENTATIVE (DATED 11/02/2015) STATED THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE COMPLETE ENGINEERING REPORT AT THIS TIME.

THE USER FACILITY CLAIMED THAT THE PATIENT SUSTAINED BURN MARKS AT THE SPO2 APPLICATION AREA AND THAT A REUSABLE SPO2 CLIP WAS BEING USED. THE SPO2 CLIP WAS APPLIED OVER THE PATIENT'S PINKY TOE AND WAS IN PLACE FOR ROUGHLY 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTES DURING MRI SCANNING. THE USER FACILITY REPORTED THAT, WHEN THE SPO2 CLIP WAS REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT'S FOOT, A BLISTER APPEARED. THE BLISTER WAS LOCATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PATIENT'S FOOT, UNDERNEATH THE PINKY TOE AND WAS DESCRIBED BY THE USER FACILITY AS 1/2 OF A DIME IN SIZE. THE USER FACILITY INDICATED THAT THE PATIENT RECEIVED FIRST AID CARE, WHICH CONSISTED OF THE APPLICATION OF A TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT, AND THAT NO FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT WAS EXPECTED. THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT CONSIDER THE APPLICATION OF A TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT TO BE EMERGENT CARE AND, AS SUCH, IS NOT CONSIDERING THIS REPORT TO BE A SERIOUS INJURY. THE USER FACILITY ALSO REPORTED THAT, PRIOR TO MRI IMAGING, THE SPO2 CLIP WAS ON THE PATIENT'S OTHER FOOT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. UPON REMOVAL OF THE SPO2 CLIP FROM THE PATIENT'S OTHER FOOT, A RED AREA WAS NOTED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PATIENT'S FOOT AS WELL (NO BLISTER). SINCE THE RED AREA WAS NOTED ON THE PATIENT'S OTHER FOOT AFTER REMOVAL OF THE SPO2 CLIP AND NO MRI SCANNING HAD TAKEN PLACE, IT IS NOT BELIEVED AT THIS TIME THAT THE RESPONSE THE PATIENT DISPLAYED WAS THE RESULT OF A BURN. THE USER FACILITY HAS ASKED THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER TO EVALUATE THE WIRELESS SPO2 MODULE AND SPO2 CLIP. SINCE THIS EVALUATION IS CURRENTLY ON-GOING, WE ARE REPORTING THIS INCIDENT IN ORDER TO MEET INITIAL REPORTING DEADLINES.><THE USER FACILITY REPORTED THAT A PATIENT WAS BURNED WHILE CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE.

IN ANALYZING THE COLLECTED DATE AND TIME, THE FLOWSHEET BY DESIGN DISPLAYED THE PHYSICIAN'S MANUALLY ENTERED ESTIMATED CREATININE VALUE AS THE MOST RECENT VALUE BECAUSE THE PHYSICIAN USED THE CURRENT DATE AND TIME AS THE COLLECTED DATE AND TIME FOR THE ESTIMATED CREATININE VALUE. THE FIRST ROOT CAUSE IS THAT THE PHYSICIAN APPROVED THE DRUG DOSING BASED ON ENTERING AN ESTIMATED CREATININE VALUE INSTEAD OF WAITING AND APPROVING THE DRUG DOSING BASED ON THE SAME DAY LAB VALUES. THE SECOND ROOT CAUSE IS THAT THE PHARMACIST WHO RE-CHECKS THE DRUG ORDERS FOR CORRECTNESS DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE MANUALLY ENTERED RESULTS FROM LAB INTERFACED RESULTS. (B)(6).

THE LABEL THAT IS PRINTED BY THE PROGRAM LISTED THE COMPONENTS AS ENTERED (INCLUDING DEXTROSE 6 MG/KG/MIN) BUT DID CHANGE THE GIR FROM 6 TO 36, CHANGED KCAL AND CHANGED OSMOLARITY. THE RPH AND RN DOUBLE CHECK THE TPN LABEL VERSUS THE ORIGINAL PHYSICIAN ORDER BY LOOKING AT THE LISTED COMPONENTS ON THE LABEL, INCLUDING THE DEXTROSE RATE (UNCHANGED AND CORRECT AT 6 MG/KG/MIN), BUT DO NOT ROUTINELY CHECK THE GIR AS IT SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THE DEXTROSE INFUSION RATE. THUS THE LABEL IS NOT CONSISTENTLY CHANGED WHEN THIS AUTOMATIC RE-CALCULATION OCCURS, LEADING TO FALSE CONFIRMATION OF CORRECT ADDED DEXTROSE. AFTER THE RN DOUBLE CHECKED THE TPN AND CONFIRMED THE DEXTROSE RATE AS 6 MG/KG/MIN (BUT NOT THE GIR), IT WAS STARTED ON THE PT. SOME 3-4 HOURS LATER A BLOOD GLUCOSE (BG) WAS MEASURED AT APPROXIMATELY 450 MG/DL, THEN RE-MEASURED AND CONFIRMED. THE PT HAD MULTIPLE BGS OVER 600 MG/DL, INSULIN WAS STARTED WITH GRADUAL NORMALIZATION OF THE BG. DURING THE ENTIRE EPISODE THE CHILD REMAINED VIGOROUS AND WITHOUT CLINICALLY OBVIOUS ILL EFFECTS. IN SUMMARY, A CHANGE IN A SELDOM USED AND POORLY DEFINED ORDER ENTRY CELL IN A TPN COMPOUNDER PROGRAM "PERIOD" RESULTED IN AUTOMATIC RE-CALCULATION OF THE TPN CONTENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEXTROSE ADDED TO THE TPN. THIS AUTOMATIC CHANGE WAS LARGELY TRANSPARENT, NO DOSE LIMIT ALERTS OCCURRED AND WAS HARD TO DETECT WHEN COMPARING LABEL TO ORDER. THE DEXTROSE INFUSION RATE IN MG/KG/MIN STATED ON THE LABEL DID NOT CHANGE ALTHOUGH THE GIR DID (THEY SHOULD BE IDENTICAL). THIS INCONSISTENCY MADE THE LABEL "LOOK" CORRECT WHEN DOUBLE CHECKED VERSUS THE ORDER. THE MFR WAS CONTACTED AND THE FOLLOWING CHANGES BEING MADE: THE "PERIOD" ENTRY "LOCKED" TO 24; THE DURATION ENTRY DEFAULTS TO 24 AND "ALERT" OCCURS IF CHANGED; EVALUATING LABEL FORMAT TO DETERMINE HOW "GIR" CAN BE MORE APPARENT; INTERNAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM CHANGES BEING IMPLEMENTED. 
1890833	0	THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR MDR EVAL PROCESS THAT WERE PROMPTED BY AN FDA INSPECTION. THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT DESCRIPTION WAS PROVIDED TO CARIDIANBCT QA: THE CUSTOMER/OPERATOR NOTICED BEFORE RINSEBACK THAT THE REMOVED PLASMA VOLUME WAS LESS THAN DISPLAYED. PATIENT WAS FINE (BP AND PULSE NORMAL) AND A PHYSICIAN EXAMINED THE PATIENT AND FOUND HIM FINE AS WELL. THE CUSTOMER INFORMED CARIDIANBCT THAT NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED. FIN (B)(4). PER A SERVICE CALL, NO ISSUES WERE FOUND WITH THE MACHINE AND IT IS OPERATING WITHIN DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS. INVESTIGATION: A SIMULATED RUN WAS PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2010 USING A TPE SET. THE SET WAS PRIMED AND AN ERROR OCCURRED STATING "PLASMA VALVE NOT OPERATING CORRECTLY", TRIED CLEARING ALARM BUT ALARM WOULD NOT CLEAR UNTIL THE PLASMA LINE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY NOT INSTALLED CORRECTLY IN THE VALVE WAS REPOSITIONED. THE ALARM THEN CLEARED AND PRIME CONTINUED WITH NO FURTHER ALARMS. CARIDIANBCT INVESTIGATORS COULD NOT CREATE THE CONDITION BY MISLOADING THE PLASMA VALVE TUBING BECAUSE THE SET WOULD NOT PASS ALARM TESTS. ROOT CAUSE: ALTHOUGH THE SET WAS RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION, NO ROOT CAUSE COULD BE DETERMINED. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT IS RELATED TO AN OCCLUSION IN THE PLASMA COLLECT TUBING LINE THAT SELF-CORRECTED DURING THE PROCEDURE AS EVIDENCED BY SOME PLASMA WASTE BEING COLLECTED. IT IS UNCONFIRMED WHETHER THIS BLOCKAGE WAS PRODUCED BY A MFG DEFECT OF THE COBE SPECTRA DISPOSABLE OR BY THE WAY THE DISPOSABLE WAS LOADED AND HANDLED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE. SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENT: POST-PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT WAS WELL WITHOUT MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO TREAT THE HYPERVOLEMIA.

2431021	1	PT WAS SEEN IN A PHYSICIAN OFFICE. THE OFFICE USES THE SAME COMPUTER SYS AS THE HOSP SO ALLERGY INFO ENTERED AT THE OFFICE IS AVAILABLE WHEN A PT IS ADMITTED TO THE HOSP. AT HER OFFICE VISIT, THE PT REPORTED THAT SHE HAD SEASONAL ALLERGIES. THE RN ENTERED HER ALLERGY AS SEASONALE (LEVONORGESTREL-ETHYNYL ESTRADIOL). WHEN THE PT WAS LATER ADMITTED TO THE HOSP, THE MEDICATION RECONCILIATION TECH CLARIFIED WITH THE PT THAT SHE HAD NO NEED FOR ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES SINCE SHE HAD NO UTERUS BUT THAT SHE DID EXPERIENCE SEASONAL ALLERGIES. NOTHING HAPPENED TO THE PT, BUT ONE COULD IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE THE PT'S ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE OR HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY WAS AVOIDED OR DISCONTINUED INAPPROPRIATELY BASED ON INCORRECT ALLERGY INFO. THE COMPUTER SYS IS DESIGNED SUCH THAT IF YOU TYPE SEASONAL AND PRESS ENTER TO SEARCH IT DEFAULTS TO SEASONALE. IT IS EASY TO ENTER THROUGH THE VERIFICATION SCREEN. THE PT ALSO REPORTED ALLERGY TO CAT HAIR AND THE ONLY CHOICE WAS TO ENTER THAT SHE WAS ALLERGIC TO CAT HAIR STANDARD EXTRACT. THE COMPUTER IS NOT DESIGNED SUCH THAT SEASONAL ALLERGY OR ALLERGY TO CAT HAIR CAN BE ENTERED. YOU MUST PICK SOMETHING FROM THE LIST. THE SEARCH FEATURE ON THE ALLERGY ENTRY FIELD IS DESIGNED SUCH THAT IF YOU TYPE BEES AND SEARCH, YOU WON'T FIND BEE. RECOMMENDATION: ADD COMMON ALLERGIES TO THE DATA BASE. ADD BOTH CAT AND CATS WITH SIMILAR REDUNDANCY FOR COMMON AND SERIOUS ALLERGENS (IE PEANUT, PEANUTS, NUT, NUTS) TO FACILITATE ACCURATE REPORTING.

1325043	0	reporter (risk manager) states that the autopulse lifeband load distributing  band would not stay secure. reporter states that the air bladder in the band inflated and the velcro holding the two-part band together separated and could not be placed back together. there is no further info at this time. several attempts to contact the user (biomed) were made before learning that he was no longer employed by the reporting agency, and therefore, no further info could be obtained. the autopulse (ap) is indicated only as an adjunct to manual cpr. in the event of malfunction, caregivers should revert to manual cpr. the autopulse in this case was not implicated as the cause of death or serious injury. >< the belts of the returned lifeband were cut by the user as their standard practice. as a result, simulated use testing could not be performed. however, the key components associated with any potential inflation (the air bladder and foam) as well as the fastening/alignment features (velcro and the plastic tab) were inspected, and were confirmed to be free of any damage that could contribute to the reported over inflation. all key components were found to be within our dimensional specification. the air bladder was also subjected to functional tests by the oem manufacturer to verify inflation/deflation properties. the results of this functional testing verified that the air bladder from the returned lifeband performed per the design intent, which prevents over inflation due to increased pressure inside the air bladder. the air bladder is designed to equilibrate with the atmospheric pressure by allowing air to enter the bladder when the ambient atmospheric pressure is significantly higher than the bladder's internal pressure. the valve closes when equilibrium is reached. the typical pressure gradient between atmosphere and the air bladder being small, the bladder cannot overinflate unless a high pressure air source (e.g., compressed air) is applied. the valve has 4 channels to allow the air bladder to reach the state of equilibrium with the atmosphere. with just one channel open, the air bladder may deflate slower but still cannot over inflate. in our experience, if the velcro is not fastened properly, with the alignment tab inserted completely into its matching slot per the instructions for use, the velcro fastening can come abruptly loose during normal use.

2393612	0	A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BECKMAN COULTER INC. (BEC) STATING THAT DURING THE LOADING/UNLOADING PROCESS OF THE AUTOMATE 2500 HS S3I (SORTER AND ALIQUOTER) SYSTEM WITH TUBE RACKS THE COVER UNEXPECTEDLY CLOSED AND STRUCK THE OPERATOR ON THE HEAD. THE OPERATOR WAS HIT ON THE FOREHEAD AND ENDURED A HEAD CONTUSION (NO CUT, NO BRUISE, SLIGHT BUMP ON THE HEAD). NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS NECESSARY. THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THAT THE ANALYZER WAS FITTED WITH OLD GAS SPRINGS, WHICH MAY BECOME WORN AND DETERIORATE OVER TIME. IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THE GAS SPRINGS ON THE COVER WERE THE ORIGINAL ONES OR HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED IN THE SYSTEMS HISTORY. NO PATIENT SAMPLES WERE INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT. THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THAT THE COVER ITSELF (AND THE GAS SPRINGS) HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LOCKING BRACKET WHERE ONCE THE COVER IS OPENED, WHEN PROPERLY ACTIVATED, PREVENTS A CRASHING DOWN OF THE COVER IN THE EVENT OF INADEQUATE STRENGTH OF THE SPRINGS. THE USER IS CAUTIONED IN THE USER GUIDE TO MAKE SURE THE LOCKS ARE IN PLACE WHEN OPENING THE COVER. HOWEVER, THE COVERS SHOULD NOT BE OPENED TO REMOVE OR INSERT RACKS INTO THE SYSTEM. THE OPERATOR VIOLATED THE INTENDED USE OF THE SYSTEM. THE OPERATOR DISREGARDED THE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND WARNINGS GIVEN IN THE BEC IFU (INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE) MANUAL AS WELL AS THE TWO SAFETY LABELS ON THE COVER OF THE AUTOMATE SYSTEM AND DID NOT OPERATE THE SYSTEM AS SPECIFIED: IFU TELLS NOT TO REACH INTO THE DEVICE FOR LOADING/UNLOADING TRAYS. LOADING/UNLOADING TRAYS IS ONLY TO DO WITH CLOSED COVERS ON FULLY EXTENDED DRAWERS, COVERS ARE ONLY NEEDED TO BE OPENED IN CASE OF FAILURE WHICH NEEDS USER INTERACTION AND FOR CLEANING PURPOSE, THE NORMAL STATE OF THE COVERS IS CLOSED, ADDITIONALLY THE STICKER ON THE COVER ITSELF TELLS THE USER TO MAKE SURE THE COVER STAYS IN UP POSITION BEFORE REACHING INTO THE DEVICE. A BEC FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS DISPATCHED ON (B)(6) 2011 AND PERFORMED TROUBLESHOOTING ON THE SYSTEM. THE FSE REPLACED BOTH GAS SPRINGS. PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THE FSE ALSO INFORMED THE CUSTOMER TO NOT VIOLATE THE IFU AND THE SAFETY STICKERS ON THE COVER.

5261154	1	THE COMPLAINT OCCURRED DURING AN INSTALLATION PERIOD FOR THREE NEWLY PURCHASED UNITS. THE INITIAL UNIT WAS REMOVED FROM INSTALLATION AND THE OTHER TWO WERE WITHHELD FROM INSTALLATION UNTIL ISSUE WAS RESOLVED. WE WORKED WITH THE CUSTOMER TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE. CUSTOMER PROVIDED NETWORK DATA RECORDING TO ASSIST IN PROBLEM REPRODUCTION TO HELP IN DETERMINING THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. CUSTOMER SET DATE OF (B)(6) 2015 TO GO TO THEIR FACILITY TO INVESTIGATE. DURING THIS VISIT WE VERIFIED FREEZE MALFUNCTION AND DETERMINED THE STATE OF THE UNIT DURING THE FREEZE PERIOD. WE RETURNED TO FACTORY WITH CUSTOMER UNITS. ALL CUSTOMERS WITH THIS DEVICE REVISION WERE CONTACTED TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WAS EXPERIENCING THIS BEHAVIOR. NO OTHER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE TO DATE. THROUGH IN-DEPTH TESTING AND COMMUNICATION WITH MANUFACTURER OF OUR NETWORK CONTROLLER DEVICE, AS WELL AS WEB SEARCHES, WE DETERMINED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION, A DEFECT IN THE DEVICE'S NETWORK CONTROLLER CHIP. IT TOOK 6 WEEKS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SOLUTION THAT COULD BE USED FOR A CORRECTION FOR NEWLY MANUFACTURED DEVICES. THE SOLUTION WAS VALIDATED AND THE CUSTOMER'S 3 UNITS WERE RETURNED ON 9/9/2015.

1661882	0	THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT ALL THE HEMATOLOGY PATIENT RESULTS GENERATED ON THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE ANALYZER SHIFTED 10% LOWER THAN EXPECTED. THE FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE RESOLVED THE ISSUE BY REPLACING A BROKEN WIRE OF THE ASPIRATION BOTTOM SENSOR PROBE. NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED. >< A PATIENT WITH MASS AT APPENDIX WITH ATYPICAL CELLS INDICATING POSSIBLE CANCER; PRESENTED FOR RESECTION AND UNDERWENT LAP-ASSISTED COLECTOMY. AFTER COMPLETE MOBILIZATION, A SMALL INCISION WAS MADE RIGHT AT THE UMBILICUS IN A TRANSVERSE MANNER AND THE MUSCLE WAS DIVIDED WITH A CAUTERY.  MOBILIZED BOWEL EASILY PROLAPSED UP INTO THE FIELD.  A GIA WAS USED TO COME ACROSS THE BOWEL AT 10 CM PROXIMAL TO THE ILEOCECAL VALVE.  THE MESENTERY WAS TAKEN DOWN USING SEQUENTIAL CLAMPS.  HIGH LIGATION WAS PERFORMED OF THE ILEOCOLIC (RIGHT COLIC) ARTERY USING A SUTURE LIGATURE OF 0 VICRYL WITH A REINFORCING 2-0 VICRYL TIE.  THE RIGHT BRANCH OF THE MIDDLE COLIC WAS TAKEN USING A 2-0 VICRYL SUTURE LIGATURE.  A GIA WAS THEN USED TO COME ACROSS THE PROXIMAL TRANSVERSE COLON.  THE SPECIMEN WAS REMOVED. A SIDE-TO-SIDE FUNCTIONAL AND END-TO-END ANASTOMOSIS WAS THEN CREATED USING 80-MM GIA.  THERE WAS NO BLEEDING FROM THE STAPLE LINE.  THE TA 60 WAS USED TO CLOSE THE ENTEROTOMY FOR THE GIA.  A CROTCH STITCH WAS PLACED USING 3-0 VICRYL AT THE OTHER END OF THE ANASTOMOSIS.  THE BOWEL WAS THEN PLACED BACK IN THE ABDOMEN. ALL SKIN INCISIONS WERE CLOSED.  HE MADE SLOW PROGRESSION IN POSTOPERATIVE RECOVERY.  SEVEN DAYS LATER, A CT SCAN SHOWED AN ILEUS, BUT NO EVIDENCE OF ANY LEAK OR ABSCESS.  TWO DAYS AFTER THE CT, THE PT HAD RAPID A-FIB, ELEVATED WBC AND SIGNS OF SEPTIC SHOCK; WORK-UP INCLUDED ABDOMINAL (ABD) CT WHICH REVEALED PNEUMOBILIA (MOST LIKELY SOURCE PNEUMOBILIA IS ISCHEMIC BOWEL OR OTHER INJURY TO THE BOWEL).  ON RE-OPERATION, ANASTOMOTIC LEAK WAS IDENTIFIED AT THE PREVIOUS ANASTOMOSIS AND REPAIRED.  THE PATIENT CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE POST-OPERATIVELY DESPITE AGGRESSIVE RESUSCITATION EFFORTS AND PASSED AWAY PRESUMABLY FROM SEPTIC SHOCK (NO AUTOPSY PER FAMILY REQUEST).HEALTH PROFESSIONAL'S IMPRESSION: ANASTOMOTIC LEAK AT SITE WHERE GIA80 STAPLER WAS USED. NO OBVIOUS PROBLEMS WERE SEEN DURING THE INITIAL SURGERY. >< (B)(4), EVALUATION CONCLUSION(ASPIRATION BOTTOM SENSOR WORN-OUT FROM NORMAL USE) AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THIS ISSUE. NO PRODUCT DEFICIENCY OR MALFUNCTION WAS IDENTIFIED AND THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO A WORN-OUT PART DUE TO NORMAL USE. A MANDATORY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) IS ISSUED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIELD SERVICE TO INSPECT AND REPLACE THE PART WHEN NECESSARY. THE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES WILL BE UPDATED IN THE OPERATORS MANUAL TO INCLUDE INSPECTION OF THE ASPIRATION PROBE SENSOR EVERY SIX MONTHS AND REQUEST REPLACEMENT IF REQUIRED. A DESIGN IMPROVEMENT IS IN PROCESS TO IMPROVE THE CABLE AND SEAL THE BOARD AND SWITCH ASSEMBLIES. >< (B)(4), EVALUATION: ASPIRATION BOTTOM SENSOR WORN-OUT FROM NORMAL USE. A CORRECTION THROUGH A FOLLOW-UP CORRECTION AND REMOVAL (B)(4) WAS ISSUED TO INCLUDE INSTALLING A NEW SOFTWARE (V4). THE NEW V4 SOFTWARE RELEASED WITH (B)(4) INCLUDES A DESIGN IMPROVEMENT FOR THE ASPIRATION BOTTOM SENSOR.

1380369	0	(b)(4). the investigation of the cell-dyn 3700 analyzer smoke and fire issue identified the root cause as the installation of an incorrect fuse (by either the customer or the field service representative) in the analyzer power supply when it is operated at 220/240 vac (volts alternating current), which may result in the possibility of smoke and fire. the cell-dyn 3700 operator's manual contains the electrical requirements and specific voltage settings for each system. there are also controls in place to reduce the risk of smoke and fire (over-current protection, fusing, safety icons and hazard warning labels). the following steps were put in place to correct this issue: a product information letter was issued on 20 march 2009 to emphasize to new customers to follow the instructions provided in the cell-dyn 3700 system operator's manual for fuse replacement. a field communication (product correction) was issued on 27 mar 2009 to all affected customers to ensure that the correct fuse was installed in the cell-dyn 3700 analyzers in the field. manufacturing instructions were changed to remove the fuse prior to shipping of the product to reduce the risk of an incorrect fuse being installed. instructions were provided to the field service personnel through an installation check list to verify that the correct fuse was installed during installation. furthermore, the preventive maintenance procedure was changed to include a check that the correct fuse was installed. >< incorrect fuse was installed in the analyzer. this is an initial report. an investigation is in process. a final report will be submitted when the investigation is complete. >< the account found an incorrect fuse (8 ampere) installed in the cell-dyn analyzer. no impact to patient management nor to user safety was reported.
2188666	1	WHEN THERE WAS FIRST SIGN OF FAILING KIDNEYS IN A CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT, A URINE EVALUATION FOR MICROSCOPIC AND CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY WAS ORDERED BY ELECTRONIC CLICKING OF THE APPROPRIATE ORDER SET SELECTION TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK. THREE DAYS LATER, THERE WERE NOT ANY RESULTS. WE LEARNED THAT THE ORDER NEVER REACHED THE INTENDED HEALTH CARE TEAM MEMBER WHO WAS CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COLLECTING THE URINE FROM A FOLEY CATHETER SYSTEM. IF IT HAD REACHED THIS SECTION OF THE CARE TEAM, THE SCREEN OF THE ORDER WAS MISSED OR APPEARED MEANINGFULLY MISLEADING TO A COMPETENT AND EXPERIENCED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. THE ELECTRONIC ORDERING SYSTEM OF ALL SUCH ELECTRONIC ORDERING MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS HAS NOT ANY RECONCILIATION MECHANISM TO DETERMINE IF ANY ORDER WAS EXECUTED AND IF THERE WAS A RESULT. THE KIDNEYS CONTINUED TO FAIL, THE LUNGS FILLED WITH FLUID, MENTAL STATUS DETERIORATED TO DELIRIUM BY THE TIME THE URINE WAS COLLECTED AND SENT TO THE MICROBIOLOGY LAB. THREE DAYS AFTER THAT, AND WITH FURTHER DETERIORATION OF KIDNEYS AND OTHER ORGANS, IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THERE WAS (B)(6) COLONY COUNT OF A VIRULENT BACTERIA WITH SENSITIVITIES PUBLISHED. THE PATIENT HAS UNDERGONE KIDNEY DIALYSIS. THAT THERE WERE (B)(6) COLONIES GROWING IN THE URINE WHICH WAS NOT POSTED ON THE EMR LAB SECTION AFTER TWO DAYS INDICATES FURTHER DYSFUNCTION OF THE ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS DIRECTING THE WORK FLOW OF CARE OF THIS CASE. IF IT WAS POSTED, IT WAS MISSED. IF IT WAS POSTED, NO HEALTH CARE TEAM MEMBER RECEIVED ANY INDICATION THAT NEW RESULTS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE EMR. IN A BUSY UNIT WITH CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS, THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO CONTINUALLY HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH USER UNFRIENDLY, DISORGANIZED AND ILL DESIGNED GRIDS OF DATA TO FIND WHAT IS NEW. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO BE USED IN THE CARE OF PATIENTS.

MR (B)(6), DIRECTOR OF NURSING WOULD CONTINUE TO BE HAPPY TO ASSIST THE FDA WITH THE FETAL MONITORING STRIP AND NOTES FROM THE SYSTEM TO CONTINUE TO POTENTIALLY IDENTIFY LIFE THREATENING FETAL MONITOR FLAWS ON THE AVALON FM FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM BY (B)(4), HEALTHCARE RECALL # Z-0552-2010 MR (B)(6) CAN BE REACHED AT (B)(6). IN THIS EXAMPLE, IT IS RELATIVELY UNEVENTFUL LABOR WITH A QUESTION OF VARIABLE DECELS STARTING TO OCCUR APPROX AT 1138. OTHERWISE IT APPEARS TO BE AN AVERAGE FETAL MONITOR STRIP FROM 0032-1138. AT 1150, A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE -FSE- IS PLACED AS OUTLINED IN THE (B)(4) MANUAL AND THE CLASS 2 RECALL AT THE TOP OF PAGE 2. TWO SEPARATE TRACINGS OCCUR, MEANING THERE IS A CLEAR MATERNAL AND FETAL HEART RATE TRACINGS. AT 1206, "COINCIDENCE STATUS ON" ALARMS. BEFORE THIS POINT FROM 1150-1206, THE FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE APPEARED TO BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY BUT SUDDENLY AT 1205, IT GIVES THE APPEARANCE OF SPIRALING AROUND THE MATERNAL HEART RATE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND W/O WELL KNOWN ARTIFACTS THAT CAN OCCUR WITH A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE. SO THEREFORE, IF A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE IS USED TO VERIFY FETAL HEART TONES AS OUTLINED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL ON PAGES ONE AND TWO, THEN THE QUESTION IS THAN AGAIN RAISED. WHAT IS TO BE USED WHEN THE "VERIFY TO VERIFY" NEEDS VERIFICATION TO VERIFY WHAT'S THERE? ANOTHER WORDS ... "IF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHEN QUESTIONING THE FETAL HEART TONES ON THE ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER ARE VERIFIED WITH A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE AND THEN THE SCALP ELECTRODE DECIDES TO CONTINUE TRACING W/O THE USUAL ARTIFACTS AND UNINTERRUPTED AROUND THE MATERNAL HEART RATE HOW IS THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL TO KNOW WHEN TO VERIFY WHAT'S ALREADY BEING VERIFIED AS OUTLINED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL?" THANK YOU FOR YOUR CAREFUL CONSIDERATION IN THIS SERIOUS MATTER OF POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING FLAWED FETAL MONITORS THAT ARE IN USE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY. IN NURSING SCHOOL WE ARE TAUGHT TO BE PROACTIVE FOR OUR PTS. IN THE FACILITY THAT I WORK AT, I MADE A DIFFERENCE BY CONVINCING ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE THIS FETAL MONITOR REMOVED FROM MY FACILITY IN (B)(6) 2010. MY CONSCIOUS WON'T LET ME STOP THERE. MY SUBMISSIONS TO FDA MEDWATCH ARE FOLLOW UPS OF THE COMPLAINT SUBMITTED BY (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 2010 AT WHICH TIME ALL THAT OCCURRED WAS A REINSTATEMENT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CLASS 2 RECALL.

A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. >< WHILE REPLACING THE ARCHITECT WASH ZONE GROUND STRAP, THE FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE NOTICED CORROSION WAS PRESENT ON BOTH WASH ZONE 1 AND WASH ZONE 2 GROUND STRAPS.  THE GROUND STRAPS WERE REPLACED WITHOUT INCIDENT OR INJURY. >< (B)(4). UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM CORROSION WHICH CAN FURTHER DEVELOP INTO AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND; THE COPPER PRESENT IN THE GROUND STRAP WAS EXPOSED TO SODIUM AZIDE FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME TO FORM CORROSION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. (B)(4) WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS FOUND ON FIELD RETURNED GROUND STRAPS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COPPER AZIDE DEPOSITS, FORMATION RATES OF COPPER AZIDE, THE FEASIBILITY OF STAINLESS STEEL AS A POTENTIAL GROUND STRAP MATERIAL AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. ONE STUDY REVEALED THERE ARE OTHER METALS, POTENTIALLY UTILIZED IN INSTRUMENT DESIGNS, THAT MAY FORM AN UNSTABLE AZIDE COMPOUND ARE GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, BRASS AND TIN. THE (B)(4) PERFORMED A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF STEEL AND TIN AS REPLACEMENT FOR COPPER. THE STUDY INDICATED THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXPLOSIVE AZIDES FORMED IF STEEL, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NICKEL AND CHROMIUM, COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BUFFER SOLUTION. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM AZIDE WAS CONDUCTED. OTHER PARTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING COPPER WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER MATERIAL WITH NO KNOWN POTENTIAL VOLATILE METAL FORMATIONS. INSTRUMENT DESIGNS WILL AVOID THE USE OF BARE COPPER OR TIN COATED COPPER IN AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO SODIUM AZIDE MIGHT BE EXPECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. THE MATERIAL OF THE GROUND STRAP WAS CHANGED TO A STAINLESS STEEL ALLOY. A MANDATORY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN REQUIRED THAT EVERY COPPER GROUND STRAP BE REPLACED BY FIELD SERVICE TO THE NEW STAINLESS STEEL STRAP. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STAINLESS STEEL WZ MECHANISM GROUND STRAP, INSTRUCTIONS ON THE REMOVAL AND PACKAGING OF POTENTIALLY CORRODED GROUP STRAPS WERE INCORPORATED INTO LABELING. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING FROM 31 JUL 2009 TO 30 JULY 2010 INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS WITH RESPECT TO CORROSION OR ADVERSE EVENTS IN CONJUNCTIONS WITH THE REPLACEMENT STAINLESS STEEL ARCHITECT WASH ZONE MECHANISM GROUND STRAP. PRODUCT LABELING WAS REVIEWED AND FOUND TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS INVOLVED WITH PRODUCTS CONTAINING SODIUM AZIDE; HOWEVER, LABELING WAS ENHANCED TO INCLUDE REFERENCE TO NIOSH, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH.

WE BELIEVE THE REPORTED ISSUE MAY HAVE HAPPENED WITH AN UPGRADE BUT CAN NOT BE CERTAIN. WHEN PREPARING COMPOUNDED IV MEDICATIONS, THE COMPONENTS OF THE IV ARE BARCODE VERIFIED AGAINST THE CPOE ORDER TO ENSURE CORRECT PRODUCT SELECTION PRIOR TO MIXING. THIS SCAN INCLUDES THE CARRIER SOLUTION AND ANY ADDITIVES. THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN RELIABLE SINCE IMPLEMENTATION 7 YEARS AGO. AT THE BEDSIDE, THIS NURSE IS EXPECTED TO SCAN THE BARCODE ON THE PATIENT LABEL WHICH REFERENCES THE SPECIFIC RX # OF THE ORDER. THIS MATCHES THE CORRECT IV PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO THE PATIENT. HOWEVER, WE WERE RECENTLY MADE AWARE WHEN A NURSE SCANS THE CARRIER SOLUTION BARCODE AT THE BEDSIDE HE/SHE RECEIVES POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF THE CORRECT PRODUCT. WHAT THIS MEANS IS EVERY PRODUCT MIXED IN 100 ML OF 0.9% NORMAL SALINE, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD GIVE THE SAME FEEDBACK IF THE CARRIER SOLUTION BARCODE IS SCANNED. AS A QUICK FIX, WE HAVE STARTED TO OBSCURE THE CARRIER SOLUTION BARCODE SO THE NURSES ONLY HAVE ONE BARCODE ON THE PRODUCT, THAT BEING THE RX # BARCODE.

PER THE CUSTOMER, SOME DONORS HAD PROBLEMS BREATHING CORRECTLY. THOSE DONORS DID NOT HAVE REACTIONS WHEN THEY WERE DONATING PLATELETS ON TRIMA SOFTWARE VERSION 5.21. SPECIFIC DATES OF THE EVENTS AND SPECIFIC PATIENT INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. IT IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME IF MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS NECESSARY FOR ANY OF THE EVENTS. THE DISPOSABLE KITS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THEY WERE DISCARDED BY THE CUSTOMER. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION PROVIDED AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE IF A MALFUNCTION WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY HAS OCCURRED.><PER THE CUSTOMER, MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR THESE EVENTS. IN 2 CASES, THEY INCREASED THE PUMP RATE OF THE CA INFUSION PUMPS ON THE TRIMA MACHINE AND DID NOT CONSIDER IT AS MEDICAL INTERVENTION. THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS WAS NAUSEA AND HE FELT TINGLING OF LIPS AND HANDS. THE PATIENT'S AGE IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED 5 CASES OF DONOR REACTION, BUT SENT PATIENT (DONOR) INFORMATION FOR 6 INCIDENTS. SPECIFIC INCIDENT DATES WERE NOT PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER.><INVESTIGATION: THE DEVICE WAS TESTED FOR FUNCTIONALITY, WITH NO PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED. NO ADDITIONAL REPORTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FOR THIS DEVICE REGARDING DONOR REACTIONS. A REVIEW OF THE LAST YEAR OF SERVICE HISTORY FOR THIS DEVICE, INDICATED NO OTHER REPORTS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE. FOUR RUN DATA FILES (RDFS) WERE ANALYZED FOR THESE EVENTS. IN ALL FOUR PROCEDURES, THE MAXIMUM CONCURRENT PLASMA COLLECTION ENDED APPROXIMATELY HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCEDURE. DURING THE PLASMA COLLECTION, MUCH OF THE AC IS GOING TO THE PLASMA PRODUCT, AND THEREFORE THE AC INFUSION RATE TO THE DONOR IS LESS. WHEN PLASMA COLLECTION HAS COMPLETED, THE AC INFUSION RATE TO THE DONOR INCREASES, AS THE DONOR¿S PLASMA IS NOW BEING RETURNED. SINCE PLASMA COLLECTION IS ENDING ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCEDURES, DONORS HAVE HIGHER INFUSION RATES FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THEIR PROCEDURES. FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PATIENTS ARE NOT REACTING TO THE AC AT ALL UNTIL THE PLASMA RINSEBACK PROTOCOL IS TURNED ON. THE RDF REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE AC INFUSION RATE DURING RINSEBACK IS ABOUT EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN (NEVER GREATER THAN) THE AC INFUSION RATE DURING PLATELET ONLY COLLECTION. THE AC INFUSION RATE DECREASES OVER THE COURSE OF PLASMA RINSEBACK. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY DONORS ARE REACTING DURING PLASMA RINSEBACK, BUT NOT PRIOR TO RINSEBACK. SOME DONORS HAVE NORMAL AC REACTIONS (NOT SEVERE) AT THE END OF PLASMA COLLECTION DUE TO THE INCREASE IN INFUSION RATE. THIS EVENT HAS BEEN REFERENCED IN A SOFTWARE ISSUE TRACKING SYSTEM FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. ROOT CAUSE: SOFTWARE ISSUE.><THIS RECORD WAS IDENTIFIED DURING A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF MDRS TO IDENTIFY RECORDS IN WHICH AN EVENT OCCURRED, BUT THE TYPE OF REPORTABLE EVENT WAS NOT INDICATED APPROPRIATELY.><INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.><INVESTIGATION: TERUMO BCT'S FIELD PERFORMANCE ENGINEER PERFORMED A SITE ASSESSMENT TO INVESTIGATE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ALLEVIATE THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE.

AC MANAGEMENT IS COVERED IN THE TRIMA OPERATOR'S MANUAL. THE MANUAL CAUTIONS THE OPERATOR TO MONITOR THE DONOR THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE IN ORDER TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO DONOR REACTIONS. DONOR REACTIONS TO AC ARE A KNOWN POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECT. ROOT CAUSE: NO DEFECT WAS FOUND WITH THE DEVICE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION INDICATES THERE WAS NO SOFTWARE ISSUE, AS INITIALLY SUSPECTED, AND THAT THE SOFTWARE PERFORMED AS INTENDED. A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. THE KNOWN POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS FOR AC REACTIONS ARE: MILD TINGLING OF THE LIPS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS AND NAUSEA.

1890834	0	THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR MDR EVAL PROCESS THAT WERE PROMPTED BY AN FDA INSPECTION. AT THE END OF A TPE PROCEDURE, THE OPERATOR NOTED THAT THE REMOVED VOLUME IN THE WASTE BAG WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN IT SHOULD BE. THE PATIENT DID TOLERATE THE PROCEDURE WELL. PRE BP 139/74, PULSE 75 - POST BP 139/66 PULSE 93. PER THE CUSTOMER, THE PATIENT DID NOT HAVE ANY RESPIRATORY DISTRESS OR OTHER SYMPTOMS OF FLUID OVERLOAD. THE DISPLAYED REMOVE VOLUME WAS 3516ML (INCLUDING 374ML OF AC). THE ACTUAL PROCEDURE VOLUMES ARE AS FOLLOWS: REMOVED VOL = 1300ML, REPLACED = 3084ML 5% ALBUMIN PLUS 195ML RINSEBACK SALINE. THE CUSTOMER STATED THE PATIENT IS STABLE AND DID NOT REQUIRE ANY MEDICAL INTERVENTION AS A RESULT OF THIS FLUID IMBALANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE. (B)(4). A SIMULATED RUN WAS PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2010 USING A TPE SET. CARIDIANBCT INVESTIGATORS COULD NOT CREATE THE CONDITION BY MISLOADING THE PLASMA VALVE TUBING BECAUSE THE SET WOULD NOT PASS ALARM TESTS. IF THE PLASMA COLLECT LINE ON A COBE SPECTRA DISPOSABLE IS BLOCKED DURING A TPE PROCEDURE, THIS CAN RESULT IN HYPERVOLEMIA IN THE PATIENT. IN THE PAST, CARIDIANBCT COMPLAINT INVESTIGATORS RAN THE SAME TYPE OF DISPOSABLE SET WITH THE COLLECT LINE BLOCKED. THE LACK OF ALARM IS LIKELY BECAUSE AN OCCLUSION AT THIS SITE ON THE PLASMA LINE DOES NOT RESULT IN INCREASED PRESSURE WITHIN THE TUBING SET BECAUSE THERE IS AN OPEN PATH VIA THE RBC RETURN LINE. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT MISLOADING OF THE DISPOSABLE TUBING BELOW THE CCM CAN CAUSE AN INDENTATION SEVERE ENOUGH TO CREATE AN OCCLUSION. ROOT CAUSE: ALTHOUGH THE SET WAS RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION, NO ROOT CAUSE COULD BE DETERMINED. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT IS RELATED TO AN OCCLUSION IN THE PLASMA COLLECT TUBING LINE THAT SELF-CORRECTED DURING THE PROCEDURE AS EVIDENCED BY SOME PLASMA WASTE BEING COLLECTED. IT IS UNCONFIRMED WHETHER THIS BLOCKAGE WAS PRODUCED BY A MFG DEFECT OF THE COBE SPECTRA DISPOSABLE OR BY THE WAY THE DISPOSABLE WAS LOADED AND HANDLED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE. SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENT: POST-PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT WAS WELL WITHOUT MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO TREAT THE HYPERVOLEMIA.

NOWHERE COULD I FIND THAT THIS SOFTWARE ONLY RUNS USING WINDOWS, NOT ANY VERSION OF APPLE MAC'S OS-X. THIS IS NOT DISCLOSED UNTIL ONE READS THE VERY FIND PRINT ON THE BOX AFTER RECEIPT OF THE DEVICE OR WHEN EXAMINING THE DISK FOR THE SOFTWARE. THE (B)(6) PAGE ALSO SHOWS THE DEVICE AS 'CLEARED BY THE FDA TO HELP DETECT MORNING HYPERTENSION' AS THE VERY FIRST 'FEATURE.' I TELEPHONED (B)(6) TO COMPLAIN, AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP PROMISED TO SEND ME A DEVICE WITH THE CORRECT SOFTWARE. A SECOND DEVICE ARRIVED YESTERDAY, AND IT ALSO WILL NOT RUN ON AN APPLE MAC USING OS-X. I BELIEVE YOUR APPROVAL OF THIS DEVICE WITH THE ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE WAS OBTAINED BY FRAUD BECAUSE THE COMPANY OMRON DID NOT DISCLOSE TO YOU THAT THEY DO NOT OFFER THE DEVICE WITH OS-X. IT WAS ALSO FRAUDULENT FOR (B)(6) TO SELL THE DEVICE WITHOUT CLEARLY DISCLOSING IN AS LARGE TYPE AS THE PROMOTION OF THE SOFTWARE THAT IT WOULD ONLY RUN USING WINDOWS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE MILLIONS OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE USA NOW USE APPLE MAC'S WITH OS-X AND THEY NEED DEVICES TO RUN ON THOSE COMPUTERS, NO DEVICE SHOULD BE PERMITTED FOR CONSUMER SALE THAT DOES NOT RUN ON THE APPLE MAC WITH OS-X.

LATE GLUCOSE CHECK WAS NOTICED BY COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE DURING A MONITORING CHECK AND CCU WAS CALLED. NURSE REPORTED THAT NO AUDIBLE ALERTS WERE OCCURRING EVEN THOUGH WEB BROWSER WAS RUNNING. THERE IS A BACKUP ALARM THAT NOTIFIES SUPPORT WHENEVER A GLUCOSE CHECK IS DUE AND THE WEB BROWSER HAS BEEN CLOSED. HOWEVER, IN THIS CASE, THE BROWSER WAS RUNNING, BUT NOT ISSUING THE ALARM, SO THE BACKUP ALARM DID NOT ACTIVATE. >< A REPRESENTATIVE OF PRONIA MEDICAL SYSTEMS DISCOVERED THIS ISSUE DURING ROUTINE MONITORING OF THE SYSTEM THE MORNING OF (B)(6) 2009. WITHIN HOURS OF RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE, THE NURSING COORDINATORS FOR THE TWO GLUCOCARE SYSTEMS WERE NOTIFIED TO BE VIGILANT FOR ANY LATE ALARMS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A RECURRENCE OF THE ISSUE WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY DUE TO THE NORMAL VIGILANCE OF THE NURSING STAFF REGARDING GLUCOSE CHECKS. PRONIA'S COMPLAINT REVIEW PROCESS AT THE TIME DID NOT IDENTIFY THIS AS A REPORTABLE EVENT. THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ALARM FAILURE WAS QUICKLY DETERMINED TO BE EITHER A BUG IN THE INTERNET EXPLORER 6 WEB BROWSER, OR A HEADPHONE PLUGGED INTO THE SPEAKER JACK OF THE COMPUTER IN THE CCU, WHICH MUTED THE SPEAKER. TO ADDRESS THESE OR ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT COULD PREVENT THE AUDIBLE ALARM FROM SOUNDING, WE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL ALERT TO THE SYSTEM. THIS 'CRITICAL ALERT' IS A NOTIFICATION TO OUR MONITORING STAFF (EMAIL AND TEXT MESSAGE) THAT IS SENT WHENEVER ANY NURSING ACTION IS MORE THAN 15 MINUTES LATE.

UPON FURTHER REVIEW, THE RADIOLOGIST SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED THAT THE PT HAD EXPIRED. MCKESSON HAS CONTACTED THE REPORTING FACILITY TO OBTAIN FURTHER INFORMATION IN ITS INVESTIGATION. HORIZON MEDICAL IMAGING ALLOWS THE STATUS OF A STUDY TO BE MARKED AS "PERFORMED", "REVIEWED", NEEDS OVER-READ", "DICTATED", OR "REPORTED". USERS AT THE REPORTING FACILITY ARE GRANTED PERMISSIONS TO CHANGE THE STATUS OF A STUDY BASED ON ESTABLISHED CONFIGURATION SETTINGS. UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS A TECHNOLOGIST AT THE REPORTING FACILITY HAS PERMISSIONS TO CHANGE THE STATUS OF STUDIES FROM "PERFORMED" TO "REVIEWED". THE REPORTING FACILITY INDICATED THAT TECHNOLOGISTS ARE TRAINED ONLY TO MARK STUDIES AS "REVIEWED". WHEN THE (B)(6) MEDICAL IMAGING AUTHORIZATION SERVICE USED TO MANAGE USER PERMISSIONS IS INOPERATIVE OR INACCESSIBLE, THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE HIGH AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL FUNCTIONS TO ENABLE CARE PROVIDERS TO ACCESS STUDIES.

1282025	1	UPON THE INITIAL CONTACT TO BAXA, THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THIS INCIDENT, BUT DID STATE THAT IT WAS 'USER ERROR DURING ORDER ENTRY.' THE CUSTOMER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR ABACUS DATABASE AND COMPOUNDER DATABASE FOR EVALUATION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE ABACUS DATABASE REVEALED THAT THE ORDER WAS ENTERED ON (B)(6) 2008. THE ORDER CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING INGREDIENTS: 40 MEQ/DL NA CHLORIDE, 40 MEQ/DL NA ACETATE, 30 MEQ/DL K CHLORIDE. THE TOTAL VOLUME OF THE BAG WAS 1000 ML. THE PATIENT'S PREVIOUS DAY'S ORDER HAD A UNIT VALUE OF MEQ/L RATHER THAN THE SUBJECT'S ORDER UNIT VALUE OF MEQ/DL. THEREFORE, BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR ANALYSIS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE OVER-DELIVERY WAS THE SELECTION OF MEQ/DL, RATHER THAN MEQ/L BY THE USER COMPLETING ORDER ENTRY. THE ABACUS DATABASE SHOWED THAT THE SOFTWARE DISPLAYED WARNING LIMITS FOR ACETATE, CHLORIDE AND POTASSIUM. RATIONALE WAS GIVEN TO ALL THREE WARNING LIMITS AS 'OK' AND THE ORDER WAS COMPLETED. A SITE VISIT WAS CONDUCTED ON (B)(6) 2008, TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. DURING THE SITE VISIT, EXTENSIVE ABACUS ORDER ENTRY TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED. ADDITIONAL HARD STOP WARNING LIMITS WERE IMPLEMENTED FOR SAFEGUARD, AND A WARNING LIMIT OVERRIDE SECTION WAS ADDED TO THEIR EXISTING ABACUS FORMULA LABEL.

2994868	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(6) THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. INVESTIGATION: THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) WAS REVIEWED FOR THIS LOT. THERE WERE NO ISSUES NOTED IN THE DHR THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT THAT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCED. THE RUN DATA FILE WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. ROOT CAUSE: THE ANALYSIS OF THE RUN DATA FILE DID NOT FIND A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE INDICATE IT IS POSSIBLE, THOUGH NOT CONCLUSIVE, THAT THE PLASMA LINE MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OCCLUDED NEAR THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. IF THE PLASMA LINE DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE PROPERLY TO THE PLATELET PUMP, IT COULD CAUSE THE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTEM EXPECTS, POSSIBLY ALLOWING SOME WBCS TO ESCAPE. ORIENTATION OF THE HEX IN THE HEX HOLDER MAY CONTRIBUTE TO PLASMA LINE OCCLUSION. CORRECTIVE ACTION: AN INTERNAL CAPA HAS BEEN INITIATED TO EVALUATE REPORTS OF ELEVATED RWBCS RELATED TO PLASMA LINE OCCLUSIONS.

temperature management system is intended for monitoring and controlling patient temperature. warnings and cautions: warnings: do not use the arctic sun? temperature management system in the presence of flammable agents because an explosion and/or fire may result; do not use high frequency surgical instruments or endocardial catheters while the arctic sun? temperature management system is in use; there is a risk of electrical shock and hazardous moving parts. there are no user serviceable parts inside. do not remove covers. refer servicing to qualified personnel; power cord has a hospital grade plug. grounding reliability can only be achieved when connected to an equivalent receptacle marked ?hospital use? or ?hospital grade?; when using the arctic sun? temperature management system  note that all other thermal conductive systems  such as water blankets and water gels  in use while warming or cooling with the arctic sun? temperature management system may actually alter or interfere with patient temperature control; do not place arcticgel? pads over transdermal medication patches as warming can increase drug delivery  resulting in possible harm to the patient. cautions: this product is to be used by or under the supervision of trained  qualified medical personnel; federal law (usa) restricts this device to sale  by or on the order of a physician; use only distilled or sterile water. the use of other fluids will damage the arctic sun? temperature management system; when moving the arctic sun? temperature management system always use the handle to lift the controller over an obstacle to avoid over balancing; the patient?s bed surface should be located between 30 and 60 inches (75 cm and 150 cm) above the floor to ensure proper flow and minimize risk of leaks; the clinician is responsible to determine the appropriateness of custom parameters. when the system is powered off  all changes to parameters will revert to the default unless the new settings have been saved as new defaults in the advanced setup screen. for small patients (=30 kg) it is recommended to use the following settings: water temperature high limit =40??c (104??f); water temperature low limit =10??c (64.4 ??f); control strategy =2; the operator must continuously monitor patient temperature when using manual control and adjust the temperature of the water flowing through the pads accordingly. patient temperature will not be controlled by the arctic sun? temperature management system in manual control; due to the system?s high efficiency  manual control is not recommended for long duration use. the operator is advised to use the automatic therapy modes (e.g. control patient  cool patient  rewarm patient) for automatic patient temperature monitoring and control; the arctic sun? temperature management system will monitor and control patient core temperature based on the temperature probe attached to the system. the clinician is responsible for correctly placing the temperature probe and verifying the accuracy and placement of the patient probe at the start of the procedure; (b)(4) recommends measuring patient temperature from a second site to verify patient temperature. (b)(4) recommends the use of a second patient temperature probe connected to the arctic sun? temperature management system temperature 2 input as it provides continuous monitoring and safety alarm features. alternatively  patient temperature may be verified periodically with independent instrumentation; the displayed temperature graph is for general information purposes only and is not intended to replace standard medical record documentation for use in therapy decisions; patient temperature will not be controlled and alarms are not enabled in stop mode. patient temperature may increase or decrease with the arctic sun? temperature management system in stop mode; carefully observe the system for air leaks before and during use. if the pads fail to prime or a significant continuous air leak is observed in the pad return line  check connections. if needed  replace the leaking pad. leakage may result in lower flow rates and potentially decrease the performance of the system; the arctic sun? temperature management system is for use only with the arcticgel? pads; the arcticgel? pads are only for use with the arctic sun? temperature management systems; the arcticgel? pads are non-sterile for single patient use. do not reprocess or sterilize. if used in a sterile environment  pads should be placed according to the physician?s request  either prior to the sterile preparation or sterile draping. arcticgel? pads should not be placed on a sterile field; use pads immediately after opening. do not store pads once the kit has been opened; do not place arcticgel? pads on skin that has signs of ulceration  burns  hives  or rash; while there are no known allergies to hydrogel materials  caution should be exercised with any patient who has a history of skin allergies or sensitivities; do not allow circulating water to contaminate the sterile field when patient lines are disconnected; the water content of the hydrogel affects the pad?s adhesion to the skin and conductivity  and therefore  the efficiency of controlling patient temperature. periodically check that pads remain moist and adherent. replace pads when the hydrogel no longer uniformly adheres to the skin. replacing pads at least every 5 days is recommended; do not puncture the arcticgel? pads with sharp objects. punctures will result in air entering the fluid pathway and may reduce performance; if accessible  examine the patient?s skin under the arcticgel? pads often  especially those at higher risk of skin injury. skin injury may occur as a cumulative result of pressure  time and temperature. do not place bean bag or other firm positioning devices under the arcticgel? pads. do not place positioning devices under the pad manifolds or patient lines; the rate of temperature change and potentially the final achievable patient temperature is affected by many factors. treatment application  monitoring and results are the responsibility of the attending physician. if the patient does not reach target temperature in a reasonable time or the patient is not able to be maintained at the target temperature  the skin may be exposed to low or high water temperatures for an extended period of time which may increase the risk for skin injury. ensure that pad sizing / coverage and custom parameter settings are correct for the patient and treatment goals  water flow is greater than or equal to 2.3 liters per minute and the patient temperature probe is in the correct place. for patient cooling  ensure environmental factors such as excessively hot rooms  heat lamps  and heated nebulizers are eliminated and patient shivering is controlled. otherwise  consider increasing minimum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment. for patient warming  consider decreasing maximum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment; due to underlying medical or physiological conditions  some patients are more susceptible to skin damage from pressure and heat or cold. patients at risk include those with poor tissue perfusion or poor skin integrity due to diabetes  peripheral vascular disease  poor nutritional status  steroid use or high dose vasopressor therapy. if warranted  use pressure relieving or pressure reducing devices under the patient to protect from skin injury; do not allow urine  antibacterial solutions or other agents to pool underneath the arcticgel? pads. urine and antibacterial agents can absorb into the pad hydrogel and cause chemical injury and loss of pad adhesion. replace pads immediately if these fluids come into contact with the hydrogel; do not place arcticgel? pads over an electrosurgical grounding pad. the combination of heat sources may result in skin burns; if needed  place defibrillation pads between the arcticgel? pads and the patient?s skin; carefully remove arcticgel? pads from the patient?s skin at the completion of use. discard used arcticgel? pads in accordance with hospital procedures for medical waste; the usb data port is to be used only with a standalone usb flash drive. do not connect to another mains powered device during patient treatment; users should not use cleaning or decontamination methods different from those recommended by the manufacturer without first checking with the manufacturer that the proposed methods will not damage the equipment. do not use bleach (sodium hypochlorite) as it may damage the system; (b)(4) will not be responsible for patient safety or equipment performance if the procedures to operate  maintain  modify or service the (b)(4) arctic sun? temperature management system are other than those specified by (b)(4). anyone performing the procedures must be appropriately trained and qualified."

1749473	1	ON (B)(6) 2010, THE CUSTOMER CALLED AND STATED THAT SHE COULD NOT FIND A SPECIFIC STUDY FOR A PATIENT. PRODUCT WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY AFTER THE COMPLAINT WAS TAKEN. THE DEVICE WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY, WE ACCESSED THE CUSTOMERS DATABASE.: SUMMARY OF EVALUATION: ON (B)(6) 2010, (B)(6), RAD TECH FROM THE CLINIC, CALLED AND STATED THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIND THE STUDIES FOR 2 SPECIFIC PATIENTS. STRYKER WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE STUDIES ON THE SYSTEM WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LOST. ON (B)(6) 2010, FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE ISSUE REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: DURING THE WEEK OF (B)(6) 2010, STRYKER REPRESENTATIVES ATTEMPTED TO UPGRADE THE CUSTOMER AT (B)(6) ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ((B)(6)) FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF THE OFFICE PACS SOFTWARE APPLICATION TO A NEWER VERSION BY SETTING UP DUAL SERVERS. ONE FOR LEGACY (3.4D) STUDIES AND ONE FOR NEW (POWER 4.1 SP3) STUDIES. THERE WAS ALSO AN UPGRADE EFFORT FOR THE EXTERNAL RAID ENCLOSURE HARDWARE TO GO FROM AN OUTDATED INLINE SYSTEM TO A NEW RAID STORAGE SYSTEM MADE BY IBM. THIS INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT DURING THE UPGRADE A NUMBER OF STUDIES WERE LOST FROM THE CUSTOMER'S DATA SET. THIS OCCURRED BETWEEN THE DATES OF (B)(6) 2010 THROUGH (B)(6) 2010 DURING WHICH THE CLINIC GENERATED PATIENT STUDIES. THE STUDIES WERE LOCALLY GENERATED AT THE CLINIC AND CONTAINED CR TYPE X-RAY IMAGES. AT THIS TIME IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE STUDY LOSS WAS DUE TO INCOMPLETE/INCORRECT TRANSFER OF OLD DATA OR DUE TO AN INVALID CONFIGURATION OF THE DUAL SYSTEM SETUP AT THE TIME. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO INSUFFICIENT DATA TRANSFER PROCEDURES, THE LACK OF A DOCUMENTED PROCESS, AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYSTEM CONFIGURATION DURING UPGRADE EFFORTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION AND FIDELITY OF CUSTOMER DATA. THE CLINIC HAS NOT REPORTED ANY PATIENT HARM AS A RESULT OF THE PATIENT DATA LOSS. THE LOST DATA IS COMPROMISED OF CR TYPE X-RAY STUDIES PERFORMED BETWEEN (B)(6) 2010 THROUGH (B)(6) 2010 ONLY.
6071760	0	leica biosystems received a complaint that tissue in 45 cassettes, which had been processed overnight on friday through to saturday in retort a and b, was very burnt" and dehydrated. the complainant advised that the reagent in each of two (2) bottles was replaced with either 70% alcohol and 90% alcohol on saturday; the quality of tissue processing from a validation run comprising a single block  which was performed following replacement of the reagent in the two (2) bottles  was satisfactory and a power outage in the building "later on saturday" necessitated re-start of the instrument as the ups was unable to support the instrument for the duration of the power outage. on 15 september 2016  leica biosystems received information that tissue samples exhibiting sub-optimal processing would be un-diagnosable. the number of undiagnosable samples was not provided. on 06 october 2016  leica biosystems received further information that seven (7) cases were un-diagnosable and would require re-biopsy. an identifier  the age and the gender for each patient requiring re-biopsy was provided. (b)(6). refer to #8020030-2016-00061; #8020030-2016-00062; #8020030-2016-00063; #8020030-2016-00064; #8020030-2016-00066; and #8020030-2016-00067 for specific details of the other patients involved.><(b)(4). investigation of this complaint found that the instrument operated within specification during execution of both the "overnight breast biopsy" protocol started in retort a at 17:48pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "gi/needle core overnight" protocol started in retort b at 17:49pm on (b)(6) 2016  from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported. it was determined that the requirement to re-start the instrument because the ups did not support the instrument for the duration of the power outage  which the complainant reported had occurred "later on saturday" (b)(6) 2016  did not either cause or contribute to the sub-optimal tissue processing reported because the processing runs from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported completed at 03:45am on (b)(6) 2016. an error recorded on two (2) occasions at 17:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 indicates that the protocol being scheduled by the user could not be run because none of the bottles designated for alcohol contained reagent at a concentration either at  or above  the minimum required for use as the final reagent. the following information was also displayed: "cannot run protocol; final concentration threshold for alcohol exceeded. replace least pure alcohol station  bottle 3." an error code recorded at 17:47pm on (b)(6) 2016 indicates that bottle 3 (alcohol) was not in contact with the corresponding sensor for 3 seconds  which is not sufficient time to complete manual replacement of the reagent; and the properties of the corresponding reagent station were reset at 17:47pm on (b)(6) 2016. resetting a reagent station sets the concentration to the default value configured in the reagent types definition unless an alternative value is entered into the instrument software by the user; and resets the number of cassettes processed and the number of cycles and days to zero. the properties of the reagent in bottle 3 prior to this user action were: alcohol concentration = 55.2%  cycles = 58  cassettes = 1296  days = 22. at 17:47pm on (b)(6) 2016  a user affirmed in the instrument software that the default concentration of 100% was to be set for bottle 3 (alcohol). as the instrument software uses reagent concentration to select reagent stations when a protocol is scheduled  the reagent station with the lowest (in -threshold) concentration of a reagent group or type is selected for the first step using that reagent group or type. reagent stations of increasing concentration are used for the succeeding processing steps of the reagent group or type; and reagent with the highest concentration is always used for the final processing step of a reagent group or type before changing to another reagent group or type. as a consequence  bottle 3 (alcohol) was used for the final dehydration step in "overnight breast biopsy" protocol started in retort a at 17:48pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "gi/needle core overnight" protocol started in retort b at 17:49pm on (b)(6) 2016. the minimum final reagent concentration required for ethanol is 98%. the consequences of using ethanol at a concentration less than the minimum required for the final dehydration step in a protocol is re-introduction of water into the tissue which cannot be displaced in subsequent processing steps; and contamination of reagents used in the subsequent processing steps  ultimately resulting in sub-optimal tissue processing. the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported was a use error  which occurred prior to commencement of the protocols from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported. specifically  a user failed to complete manual replacement of the reagent in bottle 3 (alcohol) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions detailed in the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual. the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual contains the following specific warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss.""

1245769	1	I WAS ATTENDING ON A DIRECT CURRENT CARDIOVERSION FOR A MALE PT WITH ATRIAL FLUTTER WHO WAS ON OUR RECENTLY INSTALLED PHILLIPS MONITOR SYSTEM, IN OUR MONITORED STEP-DOWN UNIT. HE WAS ON A MONITOR THAT I WATCHED DURING THE PROCEDURE. AFTER I ADMINISTERED THE SYNCHRONIZED DIRECT-CURRENT SHOCK, THE FLUTTER CONTINUED WITHOUT CHANGE. I WAS SURPRISED BY THIS AND STARTED TO TURN UP THE ENERGY FOR ANOTHER ATTEMPT WHEN THE MONITOR THEN SHOWED THE SHOCK AND CONVERSION -WITH A DELAY OF ABOUT 5 SECONDS. THERE WAS NO HARM IN THIS CASE, BUT THE DELAY WAS SURPRISING AND CLEARLY COULD CAUSE HARM IN OTHER SITUATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING PACEMAKER THRESHOLD TESTING, WE TURN DOWN THE PACER OUTPUT UNTIL LACK OF CAPTURE IS SEEN IN ORDER TO FIND THE PACING THRESHOLD AND THEN QUICKLY TURN BACK UP THE OUTPUT SO THAT THERE IS NOT A LONG PAUSE WITHOUT A HEARTBEAT; WITH A 5-6 SECOND DELAY ADDED TO THE BRIEF PAUSE AFTER LOSS OF CAPTURE, A PT WOULD LIKELY LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND MIGHT EVEN EXPERIENCE VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION RELATED TO THE SUDDEN ASYSTOLE. I HAD HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM AT ANOTHER HOSPITAL WITH THE SAME BRAND MONITOR. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE HARD-WIRED MONITORS DO NOT HAVE SUCH A LONG DELAY, BUT THE DOCTOR OR NURSE TAKING CARE OF THE PT MAY NOT BE AWARE WHETHER THE PT IS ON TELEMETRY OR NOT. ONE EXPECTS THAT THE MONITOR OVER THE PT'S HEAD IS SHOWING REAL-TIME CARDIAC ACTIVITY. THE COMPANY REP TOLD US THAT THE MONITOR IS WITHIN ACCEPTED STANDARDS AND THAT NO OPTION IS AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. OF NOTE, THIS DELAY WAS NEVER MENTIONED DURING NEGOTIATION FOR PURCHASE OR ORIENTATION AFTER THE SALE. IT IS NOTED IN THE EXTENSIVE PRODUCT INFO PROVIDED. OBVIOUSLY, PLACING A HARD-WIRED MONITOR IS ONE SOLUTION, BUT THIS FORCES THE PT TO STAY IN BED AND ADDS RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INACTIVITY. WE REVIEWED THIS THROUGH OUR QI PROCESS AT UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MEDICAL CENTER AND WE HAVE PLACED SIGNS AT EACH MONITOR REMINDING CAREGIVERS THAT A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY MAY BE PRESENT WHEN THE PT IS ON TELEMETRY. THIS IS ONLY A STOP-GAP MEASURE, AND I WISH WE HAD A MONITOR THAT DISPLAYED THE RHYTHM OVER THE PT ON TELEMETRY WITH REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME DISPLAY. FURTHERMORE, IN MY OPINION, MONITORS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS CLINICAL SERVICE.

5312991	0	THE OPERATOR DISCOVERED THE QUALITY CONTROL (QC) WAS OUT OF RANGE. THE PERFORMANCE OF QC IS USED BY THE OPERATOR TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ANALYZER IS IN CONTROL AND CAN BE USED FOR PATIENT TESTING. FAILING QC WOULD MAKE THE USER AWARE OF AN ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED PRIOR TO USING THE ANALYZER FOR PATIENT TESTING. THE OPERATOR FOLLOWED GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE BY REPEATING ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED PATIENT SAMPLES AND ISSUING CORRECTED REPORTS AS NEEDED. THE TYPE OF ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED BY THE OPERATOR. THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CLINICAL CHEMISTRY (AACC) INDICATES THE NORMAL INR RANGE IS TYPICALLY 0.9-1.1. ON WARFARIN THERAPY THE INR ELEVATES TO BETWEEN 2.0 AND 3.5. MOST HOSPITAL PHARMACIES AND CLINICAL HEMATOLOGY SERVICES WILL HAVE SPECIFIC INR GOALS DETERMINED IN THEIR SPECIFIC TREATMENT PROTOCOLS. THE OPERATOR STATED EACH DOCTOR OR CLINIC HAS THEIR OWN SET OF REFERENCE RANGES AND WAS UNWILLING TO PROVIDE RANGES. PATIENT 1 HAD A DOSE OF ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY HOWEVER THE DOSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCREASED BASED UPON THE CORRECTED VALUE FROM REPEAT ANALYSIS. THE OPERATOR'S CONTACT WITH SIEMENS GENERATED A SERVICE CALL. THE SIEMENS FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) EXAMINED THE ANALYZER, AND DETERMINED REAGENT PROBE B2 WAS OPERATING TOO HOT. THE ERROR LOG HAD NO TEMPERATURE ERRORS RECORDED. ERROR LOGS OR TEMPERATURE READINGS WERE NOT PROVIDED. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHY THE REAGENT PROBE WAS FOUND TO BE TOO HOT WITHOUT TEMPERATURE ERRORS. THE ISSUE WAS ISOLATED TO THE REAGENT PROBE. REPLACEMENT AND ALIGNMENT OF THE REAGENT PROBE RESOLVED THE ISSUE. TEMPERATURE WAS WITHIN RANGE AFTER PART REPLACEMENT. QC WAS ANALYZED AND WITHIN THE LABORATORY'S ESTABLISHED RANGES. SINCE THE REAGENT PROBE REPLACEMENT, THE ANALYZER HAS BEEN OPERATING WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. THIS EVENT WILL BE REPORTED ON THE BASIS THAT ERRONEOUS RESULTS MAY HAVE LED TO THE PATIENT NOT RECEIVING APPROPRIATE ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY, CARRYING WITH IT THE RISKS INVOLVED: BLEEDING EPISODES AND THROMBOSIS.><THE OPERATOR STATED ERRONEOUS, ELEVATED INTERNATIONAL NORMALIZED RATIO (INR) RESULTS WERE GENERATED BY THE ANALYZER. THE OPERATOR STATED ON (B)(6) 2015 MORNING QC WAS ANALYZED AND WITHIN RANGE. PATIENT SAMPLES WERE PROCESSED AND RESULTS REPORTED. THE NEXT ANALYSIS OF QC PERFORMED LATER THAT DAY RECOVERED HIGH OUT OF RANGE. THE OPERATOR MADE FRESH REAGENT AND CONTROLS AND REPEATED QC WITH NO CHANGE. THE SAME QC AND REAGENTS WERE USED ON AN ALTERNATE CA-7000 ANALYZER, SERIAL NUMBER NOT PROVIDED, QC RECOVERED WITHIN RANGES. NO ERROR LOGS OR ANALYZER PRINTOUTS WERE PROVIDED. THE LABORATORY REANALYZED 72 PATIENT SAMPLES ON AN ALTERNATE ANALYZER FOR VERIFICATION. THE LABORATORY IDENTIFIED SEVERAL TEST RESULTS WERE REPORTED BETWEEN THE ACCEPTABLE QC RUN AND THE FAILED QC. THE OPERATOR SUBMITTED A RECORD OF AFFECTED PATIENT RESULTS. THE LABORATORY ISSUED CORRECTED REPORTS UPON REPEAT ANALYSIS ON AN ALTERNATE ANALYZER. THERE WAS NO HARM TO ANY OF THE AFFECTED PATIENTS. PATIENT 1 INITIAL INR WAS WITHIN THE THERAPEUTIC RANGE, BUT WAS BELOW THE THERAPEUTIC RANGE WHEN REPEATED ON AN ALTERNATE ANALYZER. THE PATIENT RECEIVED A DOSE OF ANTICOAGULANT TREATMENT.

A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION. >< MANUFACTURER REF (B)(4). DEAR MR. (B)(6), ON OCTOBER 19, 2010 BIOSENSE WEBSTER INC. (BWI) RECEIVED THE FDA FOLLOW-UP REQUEST, DATED OCTOBER 09, 2010 REGARDING REPORT #9681484-2010-00018: MANUFACTURER REF. (B)(4). THE REQUEST INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: THE FINAL RESULTS OF ANY FAILURE ANALYSIS OR LABORATORY TESTING OF THE DEVICE LISTED IN THE REPORT(S) INCLUDING: A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODOLOGY(IES) USED, AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE FAILURE MODE(S) AND/OR MECHANISM(S) AND THE ASSOCIATED COMPONENT(S) INVOLVED, ANY CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE FINAL FAILURE ANALYSIS OR LABORATORY TEST RESULTS. THE COMPLAINT, AS MENTIONED IN THIS REPORT, STATED THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO ENABLE PACING ON THE BIOSENSE WEBSTER CARTO 3 SYSTEM DUE TO THE INABILITY TO SELECT THE CORRECT PACING ELECTRODES. THE EVENT OCCURRED WHEN THE PATIENT REQUIRED EMERGENCY PACING TO RESUSCITATE AS HE HAD BECOME ASYSTOLIC. IT WAS CLARIFIED THAT THE PATIENT BECOMING ASYSTOLIC WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM. THE PHYSICIAN MANAGED TO OVERCOME THE DISABLED PACING QUICKLY AND WAS ABLE TO PERFORM THE PACING WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES TO THE PATIENT. THE FAILURE ANALYSIS RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT FOLLOW THE IFU RECOMMENDATION WHEN EMERGENCY PACING IS REQUIRED. WHEN EMERGENCY PACING IS REQUIRED, THE CARTO 3 IFU INDICATES THAT THE USER SHOULD USE THE DIRECT CONNECTION PORTS WHICH WILL ALLOW THE USER TO PACE DIRECTLY FROM THE STIMULATOR DEVICE. IN THIS EVENT, THE USER ATTEMPTED TO PERFORM THE EMERGENCY PACING THROUGH THE PORT THAT IS CONTROLLED BY THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM INSTEAD OF USING THE DIRECT CONNECTION PORTS AS REQUIRED IN THE IFU. BY ATTEMPTING TO USE THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM CONTROLLED PORT, THE USER EXPERIENCED A SOFTWARE FAILURE WHICH CAUSED PACING DELAY. THE SOFTWARE BUG THAT CAUSED THE SOFTWARE FAILURE WAS IDENTIFIED AND IT HAS BEEN CORRECTED IN THE NEW SOFTWARE VERSION (V.1.1.2.). HOWEVER, AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED AS USER RELATED SINCE THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATION IN THE IFU AND SHOULD NOT HAVE USED THE PORT CONTROLLED BY THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM FOR EMERGENCY PACING. PLEASE PROVIDE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEVICES MANUFACTURED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS BY YEAR FOR THE DEVICE INDICATED IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE REPORT. THE BIOSENSE WEBSTER CARTO 3 SYSTEM WAS 510(K) CLEARED BY THE FDA IN OCTOBER 2009. THE FOLLOWING TABLE INDICATES THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS MANUFACTURED AND DISTRIBUTED SINCE ITS CLEARANCE: (B)(4). IF THE PATIENT OR DEVICE PROBLEMS (INCLUDING ANY FAILURE ANALYSES) NOTED IN THIS REPORT ARE PART OF A TREND ANALYSIS, PLEASE PROVIDE A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL RELATED MDR ACCESS NUMBERS, AS WELL AS THE BASIS FOR THEIR INCLUSION IN THE TREND, E.G. COMMON CLINICAL PRESENTATION/OBSERVATION, COMMON COMPONENT, COMMON MANUFACTURING PROCESS, KNOWN FAILURE MODE, ETC. MFG REPORT NO. 9681484-2010-00012 HAS BEEN SUBMITTED RELATED TO THIS EVENT WHERE THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO PACE USING THE CARTO 3. THE RISK RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE BUG IDENTIFIED DURING THIS EVENT WAS EVALUATED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABILITY OF INJURY TO THE PATIENT IS LOW (B)(4). PLEASE DESCRIBE YOUR DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THIS EVENT WAS DUE TO A SOFTWARE ERROR OR USER ERROR, INCLUDING YOUR RATIONALE. IF USER ERROR, PLEASE DESCRIBE WHETHER THIS ERROR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR AND WHY. PLEASE ALSO DESCRIBE THE REASONING BEHIND THE CURRENT SOFTWARE DESIGN OF THIS FEATURE. THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM IS DESIGNED WITH DIRECT CONNECTION PORTS WHICH ALLOWS PACING TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE STIMULATOR RATHER THAN BEING CONTROLLED BY THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM PROVIDES A CONNECTION FOR THE STIMULATOR WHERE THE PACING IS CONTROLLED BY THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM. AS EXPLAINED, WHEN EMERGENCY PACING IS REQUIRED, THE CARTO 3 IFU INDICATES THAT THE USER SHOULD USE THE DIRECT CONNECTION PORTS WHICH WILL ALLOW THE USER TO PACE DIRECTLY FROM THE STIMULATOR DEVICE. IN THIS EVENT, THE USER ATTEMPTED TO PERFORM THE EMERGENCY PACING THROUGH THE PORT THAT IS CONTROLLED BY THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM INSTEAD OF USING THE DIRECT CONNECTION PORTS AS REQUIRED IN THE IFU.

885664	0	THE CUSTOMER STATED TEST RESULTS ON THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, SAMPLE 1 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 2, SAMPLE 2 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 3, ETC. THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) GENERATED ERROR CODES 0274, TRAY IN BAY (X) WAS REMOVED BEFORE ACCESS WAS GRANTED, AND 0526, EMPTY TRAY DETECTED IN BAY (X), INDICATING THAT THE OPERATOR HAD INAPPROPRIATELY REMOVED A TRAY FROM THE RSH. CODE 0304, TRANSPORTER ERROR ALSO OCCURRED. THE RSH WENT TO STOPPED STATUS WHILE THE PROCESSING MODULE REMAINED IN RUNNING. THE OPERATOR ORDERED RERUNS FROM THE EXCEPTION SCREEN AND BEGAN TO RUN AGAIN. THE OPERATOR SUSPECTED AN ABERRANT RESULT ON A SAMPLE AND STOPPED THE RUN. REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE RESULTS WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. SAMPLE #5 HAD THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE #6. THE OPERATOR FOUND 28 CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES THAT WERE AFFECTED. THIRTEEN OF THE RESULTS HAD ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE DOCTOR, BUT NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED. >< THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. FOUR CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT CAN LEAD TO A STOP OF THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) WHEN THE SAMPLE IS PRESENTED TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE FOR ASPIRATION: REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM A ROUTINE BAY WHILE THE ACCESS INDICATOR IS AMBER; OPENING AN RSH COVER WHILE THE RSH IS IN THE RUNNING STATE; USER REQUESTING STOP EITHER ON THE RSH KEYPAD OR FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN ON THE SYSTEM CONTROL CENTER; A NON-RECOVERABLE HARDWARE FAILURE OF AN RSH MECHANISM. INVESTIGATION OF THE ISSUE DISCOVERED A TIMING-DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY-REMOVAL DOES NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CLINICAL CHEMISTRY MODULE. THIS CONDITION CAUSES THE MODULE TO RECEIVE AN ERRONEOUS SAMPLE ARRIVAL FOR TESTS/SAMPLES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DELETED WHEN THE RSH NOTIFIED THE C8000II.DLL OF THE TRAY REMOVAL ERROR CONDITION. AFTER A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY THE MODULE SENDS AN EQUALLY ERRONEOUS SAMPLE FREE MESSAGE THAT CAUSES THE RSH TO INDEX THE CARRIER TO THE NEXT POSITION. AT THAT POINT THE SEQUENCE OF SAMPLING IS OFF BY ONE CARRIER POSITION. THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED IN SOFTWARE VERSION 3.00 FOR THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM, BUT ALL SOFTWARE VERSIONS THAT SUPPORTED AN INTERFACE TO THE C8000 AND/OR THE C16000 AND RSH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS ISSUE (V2.00, V2.01, V2.02, V2.03, V2.10, V2.11, V2.20, V2.20 DB UPDATE, V2.60, V2.30, V3.00 AND V3.10). THE ISSUE CAN OCCUR ON THE C8000 AND C16000 SYSTEMS SINCE THE RSH AND THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE (C8000II.DLL) ARE COMMON TO BOTH CONFIGURATIONS. THE ISSUE WAS FOUND TO BE DUE TO A TIMING-DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY REMOVAL WOULD NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE. LABELING: THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL CONTAINS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE USE AND FUNCTION OF THE RSH. STATUS INDICATORS INDICATES THE STATUS OF SAMPLE PROCESSING AND WHEN THE OPERATOR CAN ACCESS SAMPLES. A STEADY AMBER LIGHT INDICATES THAT SAMPLES ARE PROCESSING AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED. OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS; SUBSECTION: SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PROVIDES PROCEDURES FOR LOADING SAMPLES ONTO THE RSH FOR PROCESSING. THE PROCEDURE 'ACCESS A SAMPLE WITH TESTS IN PROCESS' ADVISES THE OPERATOR TO PERFORM THIS PROCEDURE TO SUSPEND A BAY ON THE RSH WHEN IMMEDIATE ACCESS IS NEEDED TO A SAMPLE THAT IS BEING PROCESSED. IMPROPER REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM THE RSH WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE ERROR CODE 0273 (REMOVAL FROM THE PRIORITY BAY) OR 0274 (REMOVAL FROM THE ROUTINE BAY). CONDITIONS FOR THE RSH TO BE STOPPED INCLUDE: THE OPERATOR HAS SELECTED F6- STOP FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN OR THE STOP KEY ON THE SAMPLE HANDLER KEYPAD; ONE OF THE RSH COVERS WAS OPENED WHILE THE SAMPLE HANDLER WAS RUNNING; SAMPLE HANDLER DETECTED A FATAL ERROR WHILE PROCESSING. OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TO 'KEEP ALL PROCESSING MODULE AND SAMPLE HANDLER DOORS CLOSED AND COVERS IN PLACE UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE IN A MAINTENANCE OR TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE' WHILE OPERATING THE SYSTEM. OPENING A COVER DURING OPERATION WILL RESULT IN THE GENERATION OF ERROR CODE 0709, RSH STOPPED, COVER OPENED.

1287143	1	this patient had suffered a fractured hip and was admitted to our hospital. the patient's condition was declining, requiring transfer from our cardiac telemetry floor to our intensive care unit. the patient was intubated, placed on medication pressor agents for hypotension and sepsis, and was set up with a central line pressure monitor device to monitor his central venous pressures. the patient was receiving fluid boluses based on the readings from the monitoring equipment. after receipt of multiple liters of fluid, the readings were remaining lower than would be expected. after troubleshooting, the cable was switched out and more believable readings were obtained. this cable was taken out of service, tested, and test results showed it was not reading accurately. there was a pin broken and also the pin configuration was different than the others in the department. this patient expired. the extra fluid was not determined to be the cause of this patient's death, but it did not help the situation (it may have contributed somewhat, in regards to timeframe. this is unknown.) for this reason, we are submitting this report.

2326828	1	THE PT HAD A PHYSICIANS ORDER FOR CONTINUOUS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) AND PULSE OXIMETRY -SPO2- MONITORING. THIS MONITORING WAS VIEWED ON GE'S APEX PRO CLINICAL INFO CENTER (CIC) LOCATED ON THE ACUTE CARE UNIT AND ALSO CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED BY A MONITORING TECH IN THE TELEMETRY MONITORING UNIT (TMU). AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE, THE SPO2 READING DISAPPEARED FROM PT WINDOW ON CENTRAL INFO CENTER (CIC) FOR BOTH THE UNIT AND THE TMU. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE READING DOES NOT CAUSE AN ALARM TO SOUND AND IS NOT HIGHLIGHTED ON THE VIEWING SCREEN. IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE SPO2 READING HAD BEEN, THE TRANSCEIVER (TX) NUMBER IS VIEWABLE AS IF THE XPOD CABLE FOR THE SPO2 PROBE HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED. UPON VISUALIZATION OF GE'S DT-4500 FH TELEMETRY TRANSCEIVER, THE PULSE OXIMETRY PROBE LED LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED AND THE XPOD CABLE TO THE SPO2 PORT WAS SECURELY IN PLACE. THE XPOD CABLE WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW CABLE WITHOUT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THE TRANSCEIVER WAS REPLACED WITH A DIFFERENT TRANSCEIVER AND IMMEDIATELY BOTH THE ECG AND THE SPO2 READING WERE RE-ESTABLISHED WITH THE CIC FOR BOTH UNIT AND TMU. THE TRANSCEIVER WAS SET ASIDE FOR TESTING BY GE. UPON FURTHER TROUBLESHOOTING, IF THE BATTERY IS REMOVED AND REPLACED, THE TRANSCEIVER WILL RESET ITSELF AND THE SPO2 READING WILL REAPPEAR AND NORMAL OPERATION IS RESTORED.

1736801	0	REPORTEDLY, WHILE WASHING A BONE MARROW HARVEST, DURING THE CENTRIFUGATION PHASE, THE KIT GOT TWISTED AT THE ROTATING JOINT OF THE CENTRAL STEM TUBE (ROTATING SEAL). ALL CELLS WERE ABLE TO BE RECOVERED IN A STERILE FASHION AND WERE GIVEN TO THE PT. THIS REPORT IS BEING MADE DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF THE STEM CELLS CAUSED BY A PRODUCT PROBLEM DISCOVERED AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS REPORT ON (B)(6) 2010. (B)(4). THE (B)(4) ROUND BAG AND CERAMIC SEAL WERE RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION. UPON RECEIPT CARIDIANBCT INVESTIGATORS CONFIRMED THAT THE CERAMIC SEAL DID NOT FREELY ROTATE. BLOOD RESIDUE WAS NOTED ABOVE THE CERAMIC SEAL AND MINIMAL RESIDUE IN THE ROUND BAG. THE TUBE BELOW THE CERAMIC SEAL WAS SEVERELY TWISTED AND HAD DETACHED FROM THE SEAL. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE FAILURE APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO A VENDOR MANUFACTURING DEFECT. INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AT THE CERAMIC SUPPLIER, THE CORRECT PROCEDURE WAS NOT FOLLOWED, RESULTING IN ORGANIC SALTS REMAINING ON THE SMOOTH MATING SURFACE OF THE CERAMIC SEAL, WHICH THEN ACTS AS A HOLDING AGENT. THE INTERFERENCE OF THE HOLDING AGENT CAUSED THE SEAL TO NOT PERFORM AS INTENDED INCLUDING TWISTING THE POSSIBLE BREAKAGE DURING PROCESSING RESULTING IN THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF PRODUCT. CORRECTIVE/PREVENTIVE ACTION: THE SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING SUPERVISORS WERE NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE AND RETRAINING WAS REQUESTED. AN ADDITIONAL INSPECTION STATION HAS ALSO BEEN ADDED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO ENSURE THE ROTATING SEAL IS NOT SEIZED AND FUNCTIONS PROPERLY PRIOR TO PACKAGING. IN (B)(6) 2009, AN ADDITIONAL WASH CYCLE WAS INCORPORATED AT THE CERAMIC SUPPLIER TO PRODUCE CLEANER PARTS. RISK OF BONE MARROW LOSS MAY BE MITIGATED BY SPLITTING THE BONE MARROW INTO TWO BATCHES THAT ARE KEPT SEPARATE UNTIL ALL PROCESSING IS COMPLETE. THE OCCURRENCE RATE FOR THIS EVENT TYPE IS (B)(4). WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR. THE CUSTOMER IS NOT ALLEGING ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT TO THE BONE MARROW RECIPIENT AS THE CELLS WERE RECOVERED AND PROVIDED TO THE PT.

(b)(6) stated that the patient was a normal sized woman. there were no special circumstances or surgical complications. the patient had standard osteoarthritis, without dysplasia. bone quality was normal. the orthalign jig was securely fixed during the procedure; dr. (b)(6) had two assistants helping him with the procedure; they removed the jig" (pelvic base  bracket and probe) after navigating and impacting the cup placement. the jig was removed while they were putting in retractors and preparing the femur; the pins were also removed at this time  using a (b)(4) (b)(4) system 6 surgical drill; he suspects the pin broke while it was being removed. this was not noticed at the time; the pin tip was visible on the first x-ray of the patient's hip taken at the 6-week follow-up visit. after seeing the tip at the edge of the x-ray  dr. (b)(6) took a second x-ray to include the full hips. the 2nd x-ray showed the full pin section in the right ilium; the patient presented as asymptomatic and "doing great" at the 6 week follow-up visit; dr. (b)(4) explained the x-ray and retained pin to the patient. he made the patient aware of the metal in her body for potential mri procedures. he recommended leaving the pin in  since there were no symptoms or adverse reactions to it. the patient elected to leave the pin in and was "fine with it" and "accepting of the situation"; dr. (b)(6) also elected to do nothing additional due to the retained pin. he scheduled a routine 1-year follow-up with the patient  and intends to x-ray the pin location again at that time; dr. (b)(6) stated that he sees a drill bit  pin or similar fragment left in the bone of one-out-of-two hundred to one-out-one-hundred patients (from prior surgical procedures). foreign object breakage and retention in a patient's bone is an existing occurrence in orthopedic surgery. he recently saw a patient who had been previously treated in (b)(6) and had a drill bit piece retained in his ilium. the patient was asymptomatic and "fine with it."; we informed dr. (b)(5) that the pin material was electropolished 17-4 ph h900 stainless steel  and that it is biocompatible  but not validated for long term implantation. 17-4 stainless is a common  widely used material in orthopedic surgical instruments. dr. (b)(6) noted that other retained objects (like the pin and drill bit fragments mentioned above) were in the same category  possibly of the same material; dr. (b)(6) stated that the risk from the retained pin is a potential foreign body reaction "just like with any implant." there is sometimes a risk of migration with retained objects in the body  but he thought there "limited odds" of that happening in this case  given its location in the ilium and the nature of the screw thread fixation; we enquired if dr. (b)(6) recommended or made any technique changes after this incident. he replied that he had discussed the incident and the importance of inspecting pins at the time of removal with his surgical assistants. the orthalign plus hipalign instrument sets (403007) were returned to orthalign for evaluation. no issues were discovered with any of the instruments in the sets. all included parts met specifications. the pins were not returned with the sets. they were most likely discarded by the hospital after use. so the pin involved in this incident was not available for further evaluation. the lot history  including inspection records and material certifications  for the pins supplied with the sets to the user were evaluated. no issues or discrepancies were discovered.><a surgeon reported the tip of a fixation pin retained in the pelvis of a patient following a tha procedure navigated with the orthalign plus system. there was no detection of pin breakage or complications at the time of surgery. an x-ray during the patient's six week follow-up visit showed a pin section lodged in the right iliac wing. the patient did not have any complications or symptoms related to the retained pin section at the time of the follow-up visit. the surgeon and patient elected to leave the retained pin section in place. no adverse reactions or complications were expected."

1694749	1	IT WAS REPORTED BY THE USER THAT THE CLINIC WAS HAVING ISSUE WITH THEIR SCOUT LINES AND LUMBAR POSITIONING. BASICALLY WHEN THEY VIEW THE IMAGES THEY ARE WRONG, BUT WHEN THEY BURN THEM TO A CD, THEY ARE CORRECT. >< THIS DEVICE WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY, WE WERE ABLE TO LOGIN TO THE CUSTOMER DATABASE. THIS IS SOFTWARE PRODUCT, NOT SINGE USE DEVICE. EVAL SUMMARY (B)(4): ON (B)(6) 2010, A CLINICAL ADMINISTRATOR OF (B)(6) JOINT AND SPINE CLINIC BROUGHT UP A SITUATION TO STRYKER TECH SUPPORT (B)(4) WHO WAS VISITING THE SITE WHERE THEY ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THEIR SCOUT LINES ON LUMBAR MRI STUDIES. A LUMBAR TYPE OF AN MRI STUDY RELATES TO THE SPINE IN THE AREA OF THE BACK BETWEEN THE RIBS AND THE HIP BONES AND IT INCLUDES THE 5 LUMBAR VERTEBRAE FROM L1 TO L5. BASICALLY WHEN THEY VIEW THE SCOUT LINES ON THE SAGGITAL VIEWS (IMAGINARY VERTICAL PLANE SEPARATING THE BODY INTO LEFT AND RIGHT HALVES OF THE LUMBAR MRI STUDY IN THE OFFICEPACS POWER CLIENT) THEY ARE INCORRECTLY POSITIONED AS REFERENCED BY THE CORRESPONDING AXIAL SLICE VIEWS; THIS MEANS LOOKING AT THE BODY FROM TOP TO BOTTOM OF THE ANATOMICAL REGION REPRESENTED BY THE SCOUT LINES ON THE SAGGITAL VIEWS. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY BURN THE STUDY (OF THE LUMBAR MRI IMAGES) TO A CD, THE SCOUT LINES APPEAR CORRECT. ON (B)(6) 2010, FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED BY TESTING A SAMPLE MRI STUDY FROM THE CLINIC. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CALCULATION WHICH PLACES THE SCOUT LINES ON THE SAGGITAL VIEWS OF THE MRI IMAGES AS REPRESENTED BY THE CORRESPONDING AXIAL SLICE VIEWS OF THE SAME MRI IMAGES WAS SHIFTED BY A GIVEN BUT UNK MARGIN OF ERROR. THIS RESULTED IN THE ERROR WHERE THE SCOUT LIENS WERE ACTUALLY REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT ANATOMICAL AREA THAN WHAT THE AXIAL VIEWS WERE SHOWING. MORE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE CALCULATION ERROR WAS RELATED TO AN INCORRECT INSTALLATION OF OFFICEPACS POWER CLIENT EITHER INITIALLY (ON SITE SINCE THE CLINIC WAS ON OFFICEPACS 3.4 AND WAS UPGRADED ON SITE TO POWER) OR WHILE UPGRADING TO A LATER VERSION OF POWER. THIS SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED AN UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT ON THE CLIENT. THE CALCULATION OF THE SCOUT LINES POSITIONING TAKES PLACE ON THE CLIENT AND IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE '(B)(6)' FRAMEWORK INSTALLED ON THE CLIENT LOCALLY. WHEN EXPORTING THE MRI STUDY TO A CD, THE SCOUT LINE ISSUE WAS NOT PRESENT. THE CALCULATION USES A DIFFERENT MECHANISM WHICH USES LEADTOOLS. THIS IS UNAFFECTED BY (B)(6) OR THE LOCAL CLIENT ENVIRONMENT AND ARE INSTEAD PULLED FROM THE SERVER AND PLACED ON THE CD VIEWER WHICH HANDLES THE CALCULATION CORRECTLY. THIS INDICATES AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THE STUDY ITSELF WAS NOT FAILING AND THAT THE CLIENT'S ENVIRONMENT WAS THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING CAUSE TO THE ERROR IN THE SCOUT LINES CALCULATION. THE ISSUE ON THE ORIGINAL CLIENT APPEARS TO HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN PROPAGATED TO OTHER CLIENTS. THE CLINIC'S PERSONNEL UNKNOWINGLY REPLICATED THE CORRUPTED ENVIRONMENT BY TAKING AN 'IMAGE FILE' OF THE ORIGINAL CLIENT AND REPRODUCING IT TO THE REST OF THE CLIENTS BY IMAGING THEM WITH THE IMAGE OF THE CORRUPTED CLIENT. IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS POINT EXACTLY WHEN THE ISSUES WAS FIRST KNOWN. ACCORDING TO THE CLINICAL ADMINISTRATOR, THE DOCTOR KNEW OF THE ISSUE AND FACTORED IN THE ERROR OF THE SCOUT LINES WHEN BEFORE ANY PROCEDURES. HE FURTHER EXPRESSED THE CONCERN THAT DEPENDING ON THE MARGIN OF ERROR OF THE SCOUT LINES CALCULATION, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A PHYSICIAN WILL NOT REALIZE THAT ERROR AND MAY POTENTIALLY OPERATE ON THE WRONG ANATOMICAL REGION. THE CLINIC HAS NOT REPORTED ANY PT HARM TO DATE, HOWEVER, THEY EXPRESSED THE CONCERN OF HAZARD AND POTENTIAL HARM. AS OF 4/30/2010, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY REINSTALLING THE (B)(6) FRAMEWORK ON THE CLIENT, AS WELL AS THE OFFICEPACS POWER CLIENT SOFTWARE AN ALL OF THEIR CLIENTS/WORKSTATIONS. THE ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED AT OTHER SITES, AND IT IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN HOUSE.

(B)(6) IS REVIEWING A DONOR RECORD FROM (B)(6) 2009. FROM HER REVIEW OF THE DONOR RECORD, IT APPEARS THAT THE VENIPUNCTURE WAS PERFORMED ON THE DONOR AND THE SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE SAMPLE POUCH BEFORE AC PRIME HAD BEEN STARTED. SHE IS WANTING TO KNOW IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE AIR COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE DONOR. CUSTOMER IS NOT ALLEGING A DEFICIENCY WITH EITHER THE MACHINE OR DISPOSABLE. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR AIR TO DONOR. (B)(4). RISK ANALYSIS: IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, ACCORDING TO WHAT THE OPERATOR TOLD THE MGR WHO RELAYED THE INFO TO CARIDIANBCT, THE VENIPUNCTURE WAS PERFORMED AFTER THE CASSETTE WAS LOADED BUT BEFORE AC PRIME WAS COMPLETED. WHEN THE CASSETTE IS LOWERED IT PERFORMS A SERIES OF AIR EVACUATIONS AND SET TESTS. AFTER THIS POINT THE TRIMA PROMPTS THE OPERATOR TO CLOSE THE DONOR LINE CLAMPS AND THE SAMPLE BAG LINE CLAMPS BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE AC PRIME. THIS IS WHEN THE OPERATOR STATES THEY ATTACHED THE DONOR. ACCORDING TO SUPPORT/CLINICAL SPECIALIST FOR AUTOMATED COLLECTIONS, (B)(6), AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE OPERATOR RECEIVING AN AIR EMBOLISM SINCE THE AIR EVACUATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED, HOWEVER BY ATTACHING THE DONOR EARLY THE OPERATOR HAS RELEASED PRESSURE FROM THE SET AND IT WILL NOT PASS AC PRIME, WHICH IS WHAT OCCURRED IN THIS PROCEDURE. ANY AIR LEFT IN THE SET DURING AC PRIME (IN THE AC LINE) IS PUSHED BY THE AC PUMP INTO THE SET ITSELF AND THROUGH THE LEVEL SENSOR, WHICH ALARMS WITH AN AC PRIME FAILURE BEFORE ANY AIR CAN REACH THE DONOR. RDF ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THAT THE EQUIPMENT HAD COMPLETED THE PROCESS TO THE AC PRIME SCREEN (WHEN AC IS ATTACHED) WITH NO ISSUES, BUT RECEIVED AN AC NOT DETECTED ALARM AND THEN ON SECOND ATTEMPT THE RUN FAILS DUE TO THE ACCESS PRESSURE SENSOR NOT REACHING TARGET PRESSURE. CONCLUSION: OPERATOR ERROR. TRIMA V6 SOFTWARE ADDED WARNING SCREENS REGARDING HAVING THE PT CONNECTED DURING AIR EVACUATION AND TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF AIR PUSHED OUT DURING PUMP LOAD/UNLOAD.

1942567	0	THE PATIENT WAS SITTING, WITH LEGS UNDER THE X-RAY DETECTOR. THE PT'S ARM WAS ON TOP OF THE DETECTOR. THE PT LEANED THEIR BODY WEIGHT ONTO THE DETECTOR. THE MACHINE SENSED A TOP COLLISION, ALERTED THE COLLISION, AND AUTOMATICALLY TRIED TO CLEAR THE COLLISION BY DRIVING THE DETECTOR DOWNWARD, PINNING THE PT'S LEG. UPON ALERTING FOR A COLLISION, THE MACHINE DISPLAYS 'PRESS AND HOLD MOVE BUTTON.' WHEN THE OPERATOR PRESSES THE UP ARROW IN ATTEMPTS TO MOVE THE DETECTOR UP AND AWAY FROM THE PT'S LEG, THE MACHINE ACTUALLY MOVES DOWNWARD EVEN MORE. THIS CAUSED THE MACHINE TO HAVE A DOWNWARD COLLISION WHICH THEN WOULD NOT ALLOW THE MACHINE TO MOVE UP OR DOWN. THE STAFF HAD TO MANUALLY LIFT UP ON THE MACHINE TO FREE THE PATIENT. NOTE: THE DOWN COLLISION DETECTOR APPEARS TO WORK IN THE SAME WAY, THAT IS, IF IT SENSES A DOWNWARD COLLISION, THE MACHINE WILL DRIVE UP A SHORT DISTANCE AUTOMATICALLY.

1381030	0	after the spinal block was placed for the scheduled cesarean section, the patient was inadvertently administered succinylcholine instead of ephedrine. the patient became paralyzed and had awareness of difficulty breathing for about 60 seconds. the patient required a brief period of intubation and ventilatory support. the patient recovered satisfactorily from anesthesia. additional information obtained from the site: after this occurrence, pharmacy implemented a new process whereby they manually affix a yellow warning sticker that states 'warning: paralyzing agent' to the backside (white) of the label for the succinylcholine. right now, one of our pharmacists is researching switching to a different manufacturer to purchase these drugs from. the product being researched comes in pre-filled syringes and is clearly labeled from all sides/angles (without obliterating the gradiant markings). this product features better labeling. investigation: the rapid-fill automated syringe filling system (asf) automates on-line label printing by printing the label information and cutting the finished, labeled syringe from the strip. the label is affixed to one-half of the syringe barrel so that gradations on the syringe barrel are legible and it does not impair the ability to check the medication dosage. the asf is used to fill and label syringes of ephedrine (violet-colored label) and succinylcholine (fluorescent red-colored label). the labeled syringes of ephedrine and succinylcholine are stored in the same drawer of the pyxis unit. a staff member removed the syringe labeled 'succinylcholine' from the pyxis and administered it instead of the ordered dose of ephedrine. when the syringe is in the position to allow visualization of the gradation markings on the syringe barrel, only the white-colored backside of the label is visible. apparently, the staff member did not check the printed medication label prior to administration.  a root cause analysis of this occurrence will be completed. an interim measure has been implemented. a yellow-colored sticker that states 'warning: paralyzing agent' is affixed to the white backsides of the succinylcholine labels before they are stored in the pyxis. there have been no other complaints with this device other than there were some issues with a batch of syringes where the label went over the markings on the syringe.
1356258	0	the account stated that the architect c8000 analyzer has generated discrepant potassium results on several patient samples. on patient #1, the initial result was >6.0 mmol/l and the retest result was 3.8mmol/l. there was no impact to patient management reported. >< this is an initial report. an investigation is in process. a final report will be submitted when the investigation is complete. >< (b)(4). evaluation: erratic potassium results erratic potassium results and o-ring in r1 syringe. review of the complaint text indicates the customer observed discrepant potassium results generated by the architect c8000 on (b)(6) 2009. the integrated chip technology (ict) module was last replaced on (b)(6) 2009 and the sample probe was replaced during instrument maintenance in (b)(6) 2008. the customer was not performing the precision study as instructed by the sales representative, because the customer was running amylase along with potassium. the customer then performed the study with only potassium. there was no carryover of the amylase reagent from the reagent pipettor. during the syringe maintenance of the r1 syringe, the o-ring sealing was damaged and there was evidence of air bubbles or foam in the syringe. once the o-ring sealing was replaced, the syringe was performing as intended. no additional erratic potassium results were reported after the component replacement of the o-ring sealing. the architect system operations manual ((b)(4) may, 2008): section 7, operational precautions and limitations, limitations of result interpretation states; assay results must be used with other clinical data, for example, symptoms, other test results, patient history, clinical impressions, information available from clinical evaluation, and other diagnostic procedures. all data must be considered for patient care management. if assay results are inconsistent with clinical evidence, additional testing is suggested to confirm the result. the architect system has been validated for its intended use. however, errors can occur due to potential operator errors and architect system technology limitations. section 9: service and maintenance: component replacement provides thorough instructions on the procedure to remove, replace, and verify probes. section 10, troubleshooting and diagnostics, observed problems, erratic results (c system) lists the probable causes and corrective actions for erroneous results. in the clinical chemistry integrated chip technology sodium potassium chloride (ict na+, k+ cl-) reagent package insert (b)(4), literature is provided in describing suitable specimens, results, and limitations of the procedure. fibrin clots may subsequently form in these sera and the clots could cause erroneous test results. multiple myeloma samples are known to give low results on diluted ise systems due to the high level of protein present in the sample. the probable cause of the erratic potassium results was the leaking r1 syringe caused by the damaged o-ring sealing. this is the final report.

THE DEVICE WAS REPORTEDLY NOT IN USE DURING THE INCIDENT. THE CORRECTION/REMOVAL REPORTING NUMBER IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. GE HEALTHCARE INVESTIGATED THE REPORTED ISSUE AND THE COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED. THE CUSTOMER DEFINED HEART RATE ALARM LIMITS CHANGE WHEN A TRAM MODULE IS USED WITH THE B850 MONITOR. WHEN AN INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE (IBP) CABLE IS PLUGGED INTO PRESSURE CHANNELS P1 OR P2, THE CUSTOMER DEFINED HEART RATE ALARM LIMITS CHANGE TO THE FACTORY DEFAULT SETTING OF 150/50. WHEN IT IS PLUGGED INTO PRESSURE CHANNEL P3, THE CUSTOMER DEFINED HEART RATE ALARM LIMITS CHANGES TO 180/30. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED ISSUE IS THAT WHEN SINGLE HR (HEART RATE) ALARM MODE IS SELECTED, ALL HR/PR (HEART RATE/PULSE RATE) LIMIT CHANGES FROM THE TRAM MODULE ARE INTERPRETED AS ECG HR LIMIT CHANGES TO IMPACT THE ONE COMMON LIMIT. WHEN CONNECTING AN IP CHANNEL, THE CHANNEL SENDS ITS CONFIGURATION, WHICH IS IGNORED, AND THE CONFIGURATION ON THE MONITOR IS FORCED BACK TO THE TRAM MODULE. THE ECG HR LIMITS ARE HOWEVER NOT DISTINGUISHED AS INVASIVE PRESSURE (IP) CONFIGURATION AND ARE LET THROUGH, RESULTING IN THE HR LIMITS BEING SET ACCORDING TO THE IP PR (CHANNEL DEPENDENT) DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FROM THE TRAM. THIS IS A TRAM SPECIFIC ISSUE AS ALARM LIMITS ARE ONLY ACCEPTED FROM TRAM (DUE TO POSSIBLE SIMULTANEOUS CONNECTION TO TRANSPORT PRO). GE HEALTHCARE WILL BE REPORTING THIS ISSUE TO THE FDA PER 21 CFR PART 806. CORRECTIONS TO AFFECTED PRODUCTS WILL BE DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT.

NO PT WAS INVOLVED WITH THE VENT. IMRIS CUSTOMER SUPPORT SPECIALIST TESTED THE MAGNET MOVER BACK AND FORTH INTO OPERATING ROOM AND COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE FAILURE. IMRIS CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST REMOTELY COLLECTED THE LOGS FROM THE MATRIX COMPUTER FOR FURTHER ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. IMRIS DETERMINED THAT THE ERRONEOUS REVERSE MOVEMENT OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2013, AT THE TIME 12:00:23.938 IN OPERATING ROOM 1. THE FWD BUTTON WAS PUSHED, BUT SERVO COUNTS WERE SHOWN TO BE DECREASING, WHICH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE SERVO WAS MOVING THE MAGNET IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION. THIS MATCHES THE RACE CONDITION SIGNATURE THAT WAS OBSERVED IN COMPLAINT CASE #(B)(4) IN WHICH A MEDICAL DEVICE REPORT WAS FILED AND APPEARS TO BE THE SAME ROOT CAUSE MANIFESTING AS THE INCORRECT SERVO INDEX. ALL LOG ENTRIES WERE CHECKED FOR ERRONEOUS FORWARD MOVEMENT AND ERRONEOUS REVERSE MOVEMENTS (29,269 LOG ENTRIES). NO OTHER ERRONEOUS MOVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED. IMRIS DETERMINED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THAT THE MOTOR SERVO USED TO CONTROL THE MAGNET WAS IN AN INCORRECT STATE, CAUSING REVERSE MOTION WHEN THE FORWARD BUTTON WAS PRESSED BY THE OPERATOR . ON (B)(4) 2013, THE CUSTOMER SITE WAS UPGRADED WITH THE MMC 2.1 SOFTWARE RELEASE TO RESOLVE ALL THE IDENTIFIED CAUSES OF ERRONEOUS MOVEMENT. (REF MDR 3003807210-2012-00002).

1509085	0	(B) (4) THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT.  AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS.  A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. >< (B)(4). AN ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) ARRIVED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE AND INSPECTED THE ANALYZER. THE TUBING FROM THE ICT (INTEGRATED CHIP TECHNOLOGY) MODULE WAS DISCOLORED AND THE ICT PROBE WAS LOOSE. THE DISCOLORED TUBING AND ICT PROBE WERE REPLACED AS WELL AS THE SAMPLE PROBE. THE FSR VERIFIED THE ANALYZER'S PERFORMANCE WITH ACCEPTABLE PRECISION RUNS AND INDICATED THE PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE WAS A LOOSE ICT PROBE. THE CUSTOMER WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE ICT PROBE MUST BE TIGHTENED IN POSITION WHEN RUNNING. NO SYSTEM LOGS WERE AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW FOR THIS EVALUATION. COMPLAINT ACTIVITY WAS REVIEWED AND IDENTIFIED NO ADVERSE TRENDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE ISSUE CURRENTLY UNDER EVALUATION. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL ((B)(4), (B)(9) 2009) AND ICT SAMPLE DILUENT PACKAGE INSERT ((B)(4)) PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE, COMPONENT REPLACEMENT, SAMPLE HANDLING, INTERPRETING RESULTS AND TROUBLESHOOTING THE CUSTOMER'S CURRENT ISSUE. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE DISCREPANT RESULTS WERE PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE LOOSE ICT PROBE; HOWEVER, THE 1.0 ML SYRINGES REPLACED BY THE CUSTOMER AND THE DISCOLORED ICT TUBING AND SAMPLE PROBE REPLACED BY THE FSR ARE ALSO POSSIBLE CAUSES. THIS IS A FINAL REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT DISCREPANT RESULTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE LAB THAT WERE GENERATED ON THE ARCHITECT C8000 ANALYZER FOR THE CHLORIDE ASSAY. THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT CONTROLS HAD BEEN WITHIN SPECIFICATION FROM 9 AM THROUGH 1 PM, BUT BY 3 PM CONTROL VALUES HAD DROPPED. THE CUSTOMER RETESTED SUSPECT SAMPLES ON THE ARCHITECT C16000 ANALYZER AND ISSUED CORRECTED REPORTS. NO PATIENT MANAGEMENT WAS AFFECTED BY THE REPORTED RESULTS. THIS PATIENT GENERATED AN INITIAL RESULT OF 106 MMOL/L THAT RETESTED AT 116 MMOL/L. A SERVICE CALL WAS INITIATED.
1067406	0	the customer states that one patient sample generated an initial architect c8000 potassium assay result of 8.4 mmol/l. per the customer's re-run rule, the sample was retested and generated a result of 4.2 mmol/l. the sample was also tested on another analyzer and generated a potassium result of 4.1 mmol/l. no suspect results were reported from the lab. there is no impact to patient management reported. >< concomitant medical products and therapy dates: aero/c8k ict module. device returned to manufacturer: the integrated chip technology (ict) module was returned for the investigation, not the entire architect c8000 analyzer. the investigation began with testing performed with the returned suspect integrated chip technology (ict) module returned from the customer site, which generated passing calibrations with controls within specification ranges for the sodium (na), potassium (k) and chloride (cl) assays with no error codes generated. precision runs for na, k and cl were within acceptable limits. a review of the customer's results logs determined the pre- and post- iref reading variation for the suspect k result did not exceed the defined voltage drift of 10mv, so an error was not generated. however, the variation was significantly higher than the pre- and post- iref readings of the acceptable k repeat results. currently, tracking activities are in place to monitor the drift voltage limit for the sodium, potassium and chloride assays for future enhancements and improvements. a review of the customer?s sample aspiration and dispense pressure monitoring (pm) logs did not find any abnormal or suspicious pm readings. a review of complaint tracking systems did not verify an ict module product issue, and a review of the most current corrective action/preventive action metrics did not identify an adverse trend in conjunction with the complaint issue currently under investigation. the architect system operations manual (june 2007) provides the following relevant information: section 7 provides guidance and requirements for handling specimens. specimens should be checked for proper clot formation prior to centrifugation and checked for bubbles, fibrin, and red cells prior to testing. the limitations of result interpretation section states assay results must be used with other clinical data, for example, symptoms, other test results, patient history, clinical impressions, information available from clinical evaluation, and other diagnostic procedures. all data must be considered for patient care management. if assay results are inconsistent with clinical evidence, additional testing is suggested to confirm the result. the architect system has been validated for its intended use. however, errors can occur due to potential operator errors and architect system technology limitations. section 10 includes a list of probable causes and corrective actions applicable to the customer's issue under the observed problems 'elevated and depressed concentration - ict results', and 'erratic results, poor precision - ict results'. multiple causes are listed, including but not limited to sample integrity issues, sample or reagent probe partially obstructed, scheduled maintenance is due, and ict module expired or not performing. the investigation was unable to verify a specific cause of the elevated potassium result generated by the suspect sample. a sample integrity issue, such as latent fibrin formation, affecting the initial ict aspiration of the suspect sample is a probable cause, as the repeat testing on the same sample was successful, and no other patient or control results were affected, and testing performed on the returned module generated acceptable results. based on the available information and investigation performed, a deficiency of the ict module and/or architect system was not identified. this is a final report. >< this is an initial report. an investigation is in process. a final report will be submitted when the investigation is complete.

2147429	0	THE PATIENT WAS POST CARDIORESPIRATORY ARREST AND THE PHYSICIAN OPTED TO INITIATE INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA WITH AN INTERNAL COOLING, COOLGARD 3000, SYSTEM.  THE PHYSICIAN PLACED THE COOLING CATHETER USING PROPER TECHNIQUE AND ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE. AN 18 GAUGE NEEDLE WAS PLACED IN THE LEFT GROIN FEMORAL VEIN.  A GUIDEWIRE PASSED EASILY THROUGH THE CATHETER. THE COOLING CATHETER WAS THEN INSERTED INTO THE VESSEL OVER THE GUIDEWIRE. THE CATHETER WAS SUTURED IN PLACE AT 20 CM.  ALL PORTS FLUSHED EASILY EXCEPT FOR THE BROWN-COLORED PORT WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT POSITIONAL.  THE COOLGARD 3000 WAS POWERED UP AND INITIATED PER OUTLINED PROCEDURE AND APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS AFTER THE COOLING PROCESS HAD BEGUN, THE NURSE NOTED THAT THE PATIENT'S TEMPERATURE REMAINED AT 34.6 C.  THE PATIENT'S ADMISSION TEMPERATURE (FOUR HOURS PRIOR) WAS 34.7 C. THE NURSE NOTIFIED THE PHYSICIAN. DESPITE THE TUBING FROM THE COOLGARD UNIT TO THE CATHETER FEELING COLD, THE PATIENT'S TEMPERATURE DID NOT DROP. THE PATIENT WAS NOT COOLING AS IS NORMAL. THE COOLGARD UNIT APPEARED TO BE OPERATING FINE. THE PHYSICIAN REMOVED THE COOLING CATHETER. THE PLASTIC ON THE CATHETER WHICH NORMALLY IS EVIDENT TO HAVE HAD FLUID GOING THROUGH BY "WRINKLING" WAS NOT NOTICED UPON REMOVAL.THE PHYSICIAN INSERTED A NEW COOLING CATHETER AND USED THE RIGHT FEMORAL VEIN INSTEAD OF LEFT.  THE CATHETER INSERTION WENT SMOOTHLY AND THERE WAS GOOD BLOOD RETURN. AGAIN, THE PATIENT'S TEMPERATURE DID NOT DROP AS EXPECTED.  THE PHYSICIAN REQUESTED THAT THE PATIENT BE EXTERNALLY COOLED WITH ICE PACKS TO COOL PATIENT TO THE TARGET TEMPERATURE OF 32 C.  APPROXIMATELY FIVE HOURS LATER, THE PATIENT'S TEMPERATURE WAS AT 32 C AND MAINTAINED WITH EXTERNAL ICE PACKS.  IT IS THE IMPRESSION OF THE PHYSICIAN AND NURSING THAT THE COOLING CATHETERS DID NOT PERFORM AS INTENDED.

4351286	1	THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS ISSUE IS ON-GOING. THE CONCLUSION FROM THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH A FOLLOW-UP REPORT. (B)(4).><DATE OF REPORT 02/10/2015. DATE RECEIVED BY MANUFACTURER 02/10/2015. FOLLOW UP REPORT 1. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION / DEVICE EVALUATION. DEVICE EVALUATED BY MANUFACTURER YES. (B)(4). A CUSTOMER FILED A COMPLAINT STATING THAT 12 (B)(6), GENERATED WITH THE COBAS AMPLIPREP / COBAS TAQMAN 48 SYSTEM, WERE MIS-ASSIGNED TO WRONG PATIENTS. THE 12 RESULTS WERE IDENTICAL TO 12 RESULTS PREVIOUSLY RUN WITH DIFFERENT SPECIMENS ON THE SAME THERMAL-CYCLER OF THE COBAS TAQMAN 48 (CTM 48) ANALYZER. THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE CUSTOMER'S PHYSICAL NETWORK SETUP WAS INCORRECT AND THE HARDWARE WAS FAULTY. BOTH THE LABORATORY LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN) AND THE INSTRUMENT LAN WERE CONNECTED TO THE SAME NETWORK HUB AND THE HUB WAS MOST LIKELY DEFECTIVE, WHICH CAUSED FREQUENT DISCONNECTIONS OF BOTH CTM 48 ANALYZERS THAT WERE CONNECTED. THE DISCONNECTION EVENTS WERE VISIBLE IN THE RUN LOG OF THE ANALYZERS. AFTER CORRECTING THE NETWORK LAYOUT AND INSTALLATION OF A SWITCH TO REPLACE THE FAULTY HUB, NO FURTHER LAN DISCONNECTION EVENTS OCCURRED. THE NETWORK MIS-CONFIGURATION AND FAULTY HARDWARE AT THIS CUSTOMER SITE CAUSED THE INITIAL RAW DATA DELETION ON THE CTM 48 ANALYZER, REQUESTED BY THE AMPLILINK SOFTWARE, TO FAIL FOR THERMAL CYCLER B. WHEN THE NEW RUN WAS PERFORMED ON THERMAL CYCLER B, RAW DATA WAS DELETED BEFORE THE RUN STARTED, BUT THE DELETION WAS SLIGHTLY DELAYED. A SOFTWARE TIMING ISSUE ALLOWED FOR AN EXTREMELY LIMITED TIMEFRAME WHERE OLD RAW DATA THAT STILL EXISTED ON THERMAL CYCLER B WERE ABLE TO BE USED BY AMPLILINK. NEW RAW DATA GENERATED FOR THE CURRENT RUN ON THERMAL CYCLER B WAS NOT CONSIDERED BY AMPLILINK SINCE RAW DATA FOR ALL CYCLES HAD ALREADY BEEN RECEIVED. AMPLILINK CALCULATED RESULTS FOR THE RUN ON THERMAL CYCLER B USING INCORRECT RAW DATA FROM THE PREVIOUS RUN, WHICH WERE INCORRECT. AFTER THE NETWORK SETUP WAS CORRECTED AND THE POTENTIALLY FAULTY HUB REPLACED, FAILURE OF THE INITIAL RAW DATA DELETION EVENT DID NOT RECUR. THE ISSUE WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNLIKELY TO HAVE OCCURRED OR TO RECUR IF NOT FOR THE IMPROPER LAN CONFIGURATION AND THE FAULTY HUB HARDWARE. THE ISSUE WOULD REQUIRE AN EXTREMELY UNLIKELY PREREQUISITE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND TIMING TO OCCUR. THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF THIS ISSUE REPORTED IN OVER TWELVE YEARS SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE AMPLILINK SOFTWARE. THERE WAS NO HARM REPORTED FOR THIS COMPLAINT.

4046743	0	><EVALUATION SUMMARY: (B)(4). CLINICAL EVALUATION SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION A HYPOTHETICAL IMPLANT SCENARIO WAS CREATED AND MODELLED ON THE VARISEED TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEM TO SIMULATE THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL ERRORS RELATED TO SEED ACTIVITY. FIVE CASES WERE PRODUCED ON A TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEM WITH FIVE DIFFERENT TREATMENT PLANS. THE PLANS WERE MODIFIED TO IMITATE THE ERROR REPORTED IN (B)(4) AND THE IMPACT ON DOSE DISTRIBUTION WAS THEN ANALYSED. GEC-ESTRO1 RECOMMENDATIONS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF PLANNING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR CLINICAL IMPACT. THE LIMITATION OF THIS DOSIMETRIC MODELLING IS THAT THE FIVE CASES ARE SAMPLES AND CANNOT EXACTLY REPRODUCE THE SIZE, SHAPE AND THE DOSIMETRIC TREATMENT PLAN FOR THE SPECIFIC PATIENT WHICH IS UNK. CLINICAL RISK: THE CUSTOMER COULD HAVE MISTAKENLY USED THE INCORRECT SEED ACTIVITY AS INDICATED ON THE LABEL. DOSIMETRY MODELLING: THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN ACTUAL SEED ACTIVITY AND THE LABEL IS APPROX 8%. TO ASSUME WORST CASE SCENARIO, 5 CLINICALLY ACCEPTABLE TREATMENT PLANS WERE MODIFIED, SO THE SEED ACTIVITY IS INCREASED BY +8% AND THEN DECREASED BY -8% TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF DOSE DISTRIBUTION. RESULT: INCREASING THE SEED STRENGTH BY 8% COULD LEAD TO OVER DOSAGE OF THE URETHRA BY 11.3%. THIS IS LIKELY TO INCREASE THE RISK OF RADIATION TOXICITY TO THE URETHRA AND CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING URINARY INCONTINENCE. PROSTATE GLAND IS ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE OVERDOSED BY 18.6% AND 14.4GY WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH SIDE EFFECTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, REDUCTION OF SEED STRENGTH BY 8% WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER DOSE THE PROSTATE BY 15% AND 14GY. THIS MAY LEAD TO REDUCTION TO TARGET VOLUME COVERAGE WHICH CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT FAILURE AND INCREASED RISK OF RELAPSE.4. CONCLUSION: THE EFFECT OF 8% CHANGE IN SEED ACTIVITY COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE DOES DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE TREATMENT PLAN. THIS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH SUB OPTIMAL CLINICAL OUTCOMES. MANUFACTURER EVALUATION: WITH THE FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION RECEIVED, THIS REPORT IS NOW CONSIDERED SERIOUS, BASED ON HYPOTHETICAL IMPLANT SCENARIO. ALTHOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE, THE IMPLANT WAS NOT AFFECTED, DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE ERROR THIS MALFUNCTION WAS ASSESSED AS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY SHOULD IT RECUR.

5690864	0	the night shift at a hospital clinical laboratory reported that the sta compact blood coagulation analyzer was not functioning as expected. the equipment was taken out of service until a company representative was able to perform a repair. the field service engineer found a very small crack in a valve which was replaced (suspect part was returned to company for evaluation). the facility reported that there was no injury to any patients or hospital personnel. the valve from the device has been checked by the manufacturer. the presence of a small crack in the valve was confirmed. this component does not have a history of cracking in this manner. efforts were made, using the subject valve and similar valves with various defects, to mimic the hospital's malfunction experience. because the results could not be duplicated, it is not completely certain that this malfunction and this cracked component are directly linked. this event is considered an isolated occurrence.                                                              
2765465	1	DURING THE SAMPLE PROCESSING, THE AUTO-VALIDATION OF A PATIENT SAMPLE WAS BLOCKED BY THE ABX PENTRA ML, ASKING FOR A SLIDE REVIEW. ONCE THE MANUAL RUN FOR THE SLIDE ENTRY WAS ENTERED BY THE USER, THE FIRST DISCIPLINE (DIFF REPORT) WAS CORRECTLY UPLOADED ON THE LIS (LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM). AT THAT STEP, THE USER CREATED A SECOND MANUAL RUN TO ENTER A NEW WBC VALUE. AFTER VALIDATING THIS MANUAL RUN, THE FIRST DISCIPLINE (DIFF REPORT) WAS AGAIN CORRECTLY UPLOADED TO THE LIS. THEN THE USER MANUALLY VALIDATED THE SECOND DISCIPLINE (CBC) COMING FROM THE INSTRUMENT RUN. THE ABX PENTRA ML UPLOADED THE FULL REPORT (CBC + DIFF) TO THE LIS. THE DATA RECEIVED AT THE FINAL STAGE BY THE LIS WERE NOT THOSE THAT WERE JUST VALIDATED FOR THAT PATIENT AND DISPLAYED CORRECTLY ON THE SCREEN AS NOTED ABOVE. INSTEAD, THE DATA WAS THAT OF A PREVIOUS RUN FROM THE SAME PATIENT HISTORY. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO THE PATIENT AS THE TECHNICIAN NOTICED THE INCORRECT DATA BEFORE THE RESULTS WERE PROVIDED TO THE DOCTOR. ADDITIONALLY, THE TECHNICIAN CHECKED THE RESULTS ON TH ABX PENTRA ML SCREEN AND ON THE INSTRUMENT SCREEN. UPON VERIFICATION OF THE CORRECT RESULTS, THE TECHNICIAN PROVIDED THE CORRECT INFORMATION TO THE DOCTOR. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. HOWEVER, AFTER CHECKING THE DATABASE AND THE FILES EXCHANGED BY THE ABX PENTRA ML AND THE LIS, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT A "GHOST RUN" WAS CREATED BY THE ABX PENTRA ML BETWEEN THE LAST MANUAL RUN AND THE REPORT OF THE CONCERNED PATIENT SAMPLE RUN. WHILE A ROOT CAUSE FOR THE "GHOST RUN" CONTINUES TO BE INVESTIGATED. THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION RESULTS HAS CONFIRMED THAT TWO SCENARIOS MAY OCCUR DEPENDING ON THE ABX PENTRA ML SOFTWARE VERSION AND WHETHER THE CONTROL (DISCIPLINE) FEATURE IS AVAILABLE OR NOT. SOFTWARE VERSION V8.0.X AND BELOW: THE COHERENCE OF ALL RESULTS BEING MANUALLY RE-UPLOADED TO THE LIS MUST BE SYSTEMATICALLY CHECKED. SOFTWARE VERSIONS V9.0.1 AND V9.0.2: IN THE CASE WHERE THE "DISCIPLINE" FEATURE IS USED, AFTER AN ENTRY OF RESULT IN A MANUAL RUN, THE COHERENCE OF ALL DATA UPLOADED TO THE LIS MUST BE CHECKED FOR THE PATIENT FILE.

2027731	0	THE REPORTER, THE PATIENT'S FATHER, REPORTED THAT ON (B)(6) 2011, THE PATIENT OBTAINED BLOOD GLUCOSE READINGS OF 500 MG/DL TO 'HI MG/DL' (GREATER THAN 600 MG/DL) WHILE USING THE INSULIN PUMP. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED NO SYMPTOMS OF HIGH OR LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AND TESTED NEGATIVE FOR KETONES. THE PATIENT PROGRAMMED BOLUSES FOR THE ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS, BUT REPORTED HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL DID NOT BECOME LOWER UNTIL A MANUAL INSULIN INJECTION WAS GIVEN. AT THE TIME OF THE TROUBLESHOOTING TELEPHONE CALL, THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE READING WAS 130 MG/DL. TROUBLESHOOTING REVEALED THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF KINKS OR BUBBLES IN THE CANNULA, NO PROBLEMS AT THE SITE, NO LEAKS, AND THE TOTAL BOLUS/BASAL UNITS DELIVERED MATCH THOSE PROGRAMMED INTO THE PUMP. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ALSO DETERMINED DURING THIS TELEPHONE CALL THAT THE PATIENT WAS USING REFRIGERATED INSULIN INSTEAD OF ROOM TEMPERATURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE BUBBLE FORMATION. THE PUMP HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO ANIMAS FOR EVALUATION. IF THE DEVICE IS RETURNED, AN EVALUATION SHALL BE COMPLETED AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED. NO CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME.><DEVICE EVALUATION: THE PUMP HAS BEEN RETURNED AND EVALUATED BY PRODUCT ANALYSIS ON (B)(6) 2011 WITH THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: A REVIEW OF THE PUMP'S TOTAL DAILY DOSE HISTORY INDICATED THAT INSULIN DELIVERY TOTALS CORRECTLY REFLECTED PROGRAMMED VALUES. THE PUMP HISTORY INDICATED THAT MULTIPLE OCCLUSION ALARMS OCCURRED, WHICH COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED DURING TESTING. THE PUMP WAS EXERCISED FOR 29 HOURS WITH NO INSULIN DELIVERY ISSUES OCCURRING. AN EZPRIME OPERATION WAS PERFORMED, WITH NO ISSUES OCCURRING. A NORMAL BOLUS AND AN AUDIO BOLUS WERE PERFORMED AND WERE CORRECTLY RECORDED IN THE PUMP HISTORY. THE UNITS REMAINING WERE CORRECTLY CALCULATED DURING BOTH TYPES OF BOLUSES. UNRELATED TO THE COMPLAINT, EVALUATION REVEALED THAT THE BOLUS BUTTON COVER WAS MISSING. THE BOLUS BUTTON WAS FOUND TO BE RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY WHEN PRESSED. INSULIN CAN BE DELIVERED USING THE NORMAL BOLUS FEATURE. THIS DEFECT IS GENERALLY OBVIOUS AND DETECTABLE TO THE USER AND IS NOT LIKELY TO CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO AN ADVERSE EVENT.

1431486	1	product is a software manufacturer, called interplant, manufactured by cms software, problem being reported, due to product problem -confusion- and product user error -not behaving as expected-. used device to capture ultrasound images in planes z=0 through z=4.0cm. a plan was automatically generated that included needles containing 5 radioactive seeds with 1cm spacings. this results in seeds at slices z=0,1.2,3,4. seeds are also displayed on these slice images. software feature allows needles to be inserted/retracted. when needles were retracted, some of the seeds could no longer be visualized, because no images existed for them to be displayed upon. we expect seeds to be available only on the images. this results in a plan being generated with more radioactive seeds than we are aware of the plan needing. this also results in seeds being placed where they are not needed. the device prints out a diagram showing needle location, location of seeds within the needle, and retraction of the needle within the pt. there was no visual alert showing seeds were being placed outside the captured ultrasound images. effect on the pt should be minimal in this particular case, but in extreme cases, could result in a less than optimal treatment for prostate cancer, due to radioactive seeds being placed in location where there is no cancer. i've phoned the manufacturer and alerted them to this problem. they report the work around is to be more aware of the seed location from the print out and within the software. i've requested a change to the software, so it behaves in a more intuitive way or displays a message stating there are seeds in locations where there are no images. dose: na. diagnosis: prostate cancer.

1803659	0	OUR HOSPITAL HAD USED A PRODUCT FROM GE NAMED 'MEDISORB' FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, WITH NO ISSUES OR CONCERNS. THIS PRODUCT IS A CO2 ABSORBENT USED IN ALL OF OUR ANESTHESIA MACHINES. IN EARLY JULY IT WAS NOTED THAT OUR FACILITY STARTED RECEIVING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT FROM GE. INITIALLY WE RETURNED THE PRODUCT THINKING IT WAS AN ERROR IN ORDERING. WE AGAIN RECEIVED AND RETURNED THE DIFFERENT PRODUCT. UPON QUESTIONING, GE STATED THEY HAD DISCONTINUED MAKING MEDISORB AND THAT THEY HAD SENT A LETTER WHICH OUR MATERIALS MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT DID NOT RECEIVE. WE HAVE MULTIPLE CONCERNS WITH THE REPLACEMENT PRODUCT: 1. THE LID TO THE CANISTERS CONTAINING THE SODASORB ARE NOT GROOVED IN ANY WAY, THEY JUST SIT ON THE BASE WHICH ALLOWS THE LID TO 'POP OFF' EASILY LETTING THE TOXIC PELLETS INTO THE OPERATING ROOMS. 2. THE TOP EDGE OF THE BASE PORTION OF THE CANISTER HAS CRACKED IN SEVERAL INSTANCES WHICH ALLOWS PRESSURE LEAKS AND EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF DUST IN THE OR'S. IN THE PAST 2 WEEKS OUR ANESTHESIA MACHINES HAVE HAD TO BE REPAIRED/CLEANED TWICE DUE TO EXCESSIVE DUST. THE DUST CAUSES MACHINE LEAKS, GETS EVERYWHERE, ON THE MACHINE SEALS AND IN THE PAST IT HAS EVEN MADE IT THROUGH THE MACHINE TO THE PATIENT CIRCUIT. 3. THE REPLACEMENT PRODUCT IS NOT LABELED WITH A PRODUCT NAME. THE CANISTER JUST STATES PREPACKAGED CARTRIDGE, ORIGINAL, DISPOSABLE. THERE ALSO APPEAR TO BE 2 LOT NUMBERS ON THE PACKAGING WITH NEITHER OF THEM BEING LOCATED WHERE THE CANISTER SAYS 'LOT'. ONE IS PRINTED IN SMALL LETTERS RUNNING HORIZONTALLY ON CANISTER...THE OTHER IS AROUND THE UPPER LIP OF CANISTER. 4. IT IS FELT BY ANESTHESIOLOGY STAFF THAT THE SODASORB HEATS TO A MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN THE ORIGINAL MEDISORB AND APPEARS TO NEED CHANGING WITH HIGHER FREQUENCY. IT IS ALSO TAKING STAFF A LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME TROUBLESHOOTING ISSUES, SAFELY REMOVING EXCESS DUST OUT OF THE PRODUCT WITHOUT COMPACTING THE GRANULES IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE UTMOST CO2 ABSORPTION. 5. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD OTHER FACILITIES HAVE STARTED VOICING SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AND GE HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT A MOVEMENT FOR CHANGE MAY BE STARTING. OUR FACILITY WILL NOT BE USING THIS PRODUCT. WE FEEL IT IS UNSAFE TO OUR PATIENTS, OUR STAFF AND OUR EQUIPMENT. BOTH CANISTERS ARE FROM SAME LOT NUMBER.

2806103	0	I HAD AN ANGIOGRAPHY BY ROUTE OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY IN (B)(6) 2008. AFTER THE PROCEDURE, THE NURSE HANDED ME A BROCHURE AND SAID THAT I RECEIVED THE STARCLOSE DEVICE. NO CONSENT WAS GIVEN FOR THIS DEVICE PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE. AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES WHEN I GOT UP, MY RIGHT LEG WAS MOSTLY NUMB. I ASKED IF HIS WAS NORMAL AND WAS TOLD BY THE NURSE: IT CAN HAPPEN. I HAD DIFFICULTY WALKING TO THE CAR AFTER BEING RELEASED. SEVERAL HOURS LATER, I STARTED HAVING SEVERE PAIN DOWN THE INSIDE OF MY RIGHT LEG. SINCE THE PAIN PERSISTED FOR SEVERAL DAYS, A SONOGRAM WAS ORDERED TO SEE IF I HAD ANEURYSM AT THE SITE OF INSERTION. NONE WERE FOUND. AS A PHYSICIAN, I KNEW THAT MY FEMORAL NERVE WAS BEING IMPINGED UPON, SO I HAD A MRI DONE. IT SHOWED THAT THE STARCLOSE DEVICE WAS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FEMORAL NERVE. IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THE DEVICE WAS COMPRESSING UPON THE FEMORAL NERVE WITH CERTAIN MOVEMENTS OF MY LEG. SPECIFICALLY WITH ABDUCTION, EXTERNAL ROTATION AND HIP FLEXION. I SAW THE CARDIOLOGIST WHO PERFORMED THE PROCEDURE, DR (B)(6), AND HE SAID THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT POSSIBLE AND DISMISSED THE COMPLICATION. I ENDED UP SEEING A VASCULAR SURGEON IN 2009 TO DISCUSS RESECTING THE FEMORAL ARTERY AND REMOVING THE STARCLOSE DEVICE, BUT HE SAID THAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE JUMPING FROM THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE. IN OTHER WORDS REMOVING IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE. AS A RESULT, I APPARENTLY WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH LIMITED ACTIVITY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, ENDURE A LOT OF PAIN BECAUSE DOCTORS LIKE DR (B)(6) FROM (B)(6) DON'T WANT TO TARNISH THEIR REPUTATION BY REPORTING COMPLICATIONS. REPORTING THESE PROBLEMS IS HOW DANGEROUS PRODUCTS GET REMOVED FROM THE MARKET. UNFORTUNATELY, FEAR OF LAWSUITS AND PERHAPS EGOIC BEHAVIOR, ALONG WITH FORMS OF KICKBACKS MAY PREVENT PROPER REPORTING. HOPEFULLY, MY TIME SPENT ON THIS TOPIC WILL HELP TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM SUFFERING LIKE I HAVE AND WILL. NO OTHER COMPLICATING CONDITIONS EXIST HAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROCEDURE. THE STARCLOSE DEVICE WAS SIMPLY PLACED AGAINST THE FEMORAL NERVE AND IS NOW PERIODICALLY COMPRESSING UPON IT CAUSING A PERMANENT IATROGENIC FEMORAL NEUROPATHY. DIAGNOSIS OR REASON FOR USE: CHEST PAIN LEAD TO ANGIOGRAM.

2724880	0	THE USER FACILITY OBSERVED A FALSE HIGH PLATELET COUNT (PLT) ON A BURN PATIENT IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. A COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) AND NUCLEATED RED BLOOD CELLS (NRBC) WERE ANALYZED ON AN XE-5000 AUTOMATED HEMATOLOGY ANALYZER AT 13:11 IN THE AUTOMATED MODE. THE SAMPLE WAS JUDGED "NEGATIVE" WITH NO FLAGS. WORK AREA MANAGER (WAM) MIDDLEWARE HELD THE REPORT AS THE PLTS RESULTS WERE A CRITICAL HIGH VALUE. THE RESULTS WERE RELEASED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A VALUE OF PLT=770. THE OPERATOR OF THE DEVICE WAS UNAWARE AT THE TIME THAT THE PT WAS BEING TREATED AS A BURN PT. THE USER INDICATED THAT AT AN UNSPECIFIED TIME, A PHASE MICROSCOPY PERFORMED WITH PLT=105. THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE WAS REPEATED, USING TWO ADDITIONAL CHANNELS FOR A CBC+ DIFFERENTIAL (DIFF) +NRBC+RETICULOCYTE AT 15:24 WITH A REPORTED PLT=751. THE SAMPLE RESULTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS "POSITIVE" WITH MORPHOLOGY AND COUNT ERRORS. A SECOND BLOOD SAMPLE WAS DRAWN IN THE INTENSIVE CARE BURN UNIT. THE SAMPLE WAS ANALYZED AT 17:10 FOR CBC AND DIFF +NRBC IN THE AUTOMATED MODE-PLT=611, "POSITIVE" WITH A COUNT ERROR. THE PT WAS REMOVED FROM LIFE SUPPORT AT AN UNSPECIFIED TIME AND EXPIRED. A REVIEW OF THE USER FACILITY XE-5000 CONTROLLER SETTING REVEALED THAT THE USER FACILITY CHOSE NOT TO SET FLAG FORMULAS ON THE ANALYZER. FLAG FORMULAS ARE DESIGNED FOR THE USER TO ESTABLISH JUDGMENT LIMITS FOR ABNORMAL BLOOD CONDITIONS. THE ACTUAL XE-5000 DEVICE WAS EVALUATED AT THE USER FACILITY. THE EVALUATION DID NOT REVEAL A ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED EVENT; HOWEVER, THE USER FACILITY, IN CHOOSING TO NOT SET FLAG FORMULAS FOR THE ANALYZER, THE RESULTS COULD NOT BE FLAGGED IN THE FINAL PRINTED RESULT. THE WORK AREA MANAGEMENT (WAM) SOFTWARE RULE THRESHOLD FOR THE USER FACILITY WAS SET FOR A VALUE LESS THAN 600 X 10^9/L; THEREFORE, THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO CAPTURE A VALUE OVER 600. THERE ARE LIMITATIONS OF IMPEDANCE COUNTING AS NOTED IN THE USER MANUAL. GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE WOULD INCLUDE UTILIZING FLAG FORMULAS IN CONJUNCTION WITH WAM RULES. THE ANALYZER AND WAM FUNCTIONED AS DESIGNED. BURN PTS WITH GREATER THAN 20% OF THE BODY AFFECTED MAY EXPERIENCE MORPHOLOGIC RBC CHANGES INCLUDING GLOBULAR FRAGMENTATION, BUDDING AND MICROSPHERES.

2154693	1	PHILIPS BEDSIDE PATIENT MONITORS IN CICU HAVE FALSE ASYSTOLE ALARMS AT A MUCH MORE FREQUENT RATE SINCE THE INSTALLATION OF WIRELESS LAPTOPS FOR EPIC. THE MONITOR WILL DISPLAY A NORMAL ECG AND THEN SUDDENLY SHOW A FLAT LINE FOR ECG AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS ALARM ASYSTOLE. THE ECG CONTINUES WITH A FLAT LINE BETWEEN 1 TO 5 MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY RETURNS. ALL OTHER MONITORED PARAMETERS (INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE, PULSE OXIMETRY, TEMPERATURE) ARE NOT AFFECTED AND CONTINUE AS NORMAL DURING THE FALSE ASYSTOLE ALARM. INFORMATION SERVICES HAS ADDED 6 WIRELESS LAPTOPS IN EACH CICU POD AND MOST PODS HAVE THE ADDITION OF A WIRELESS ACCESS POINT ON TOP OF THE MEDICATION OR SUPPLY DISPENSER. POSSIBLE RF INTERFERENCE FROM INCREASED LEVEL OF RADIO FREQUENCY ACTIVITY IN THE CICU PODS. ON (B)(6) 2011, CLINICAL ENGINEERING CONTACTED PHILIPS RELATED TO THE MORE FREQUENT APPEARANCE OF FALSE ASYSTOLE ALARMS. PHILIPS REVIEWED THEIR TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A FIRMWARE UPGRADE THAT MAY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. CURRENT FIRMWARE WAS D.02.02, UPGRADED FIRMWARE IS D.02.05. THE ECG FIRMWARE IS PART OF THE INTELLIVUE X2 (MODEL M3002A). CLINICAL ENGINEERING AND PHILIPS INSTALLED THE UPGRADED FIRMWARE IN ALL X2 MODULES FOUND IN CICU. THIS UPGRADE RESOLVED THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. NO PATIENT MONITORS HAD FALSE ASYSTOLE ALARMS DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS. PHILIPS INDICATED THAT THE FIRMWARE UPGRADE INCREASED NOISE IMMUNITY OR SUPPRESSION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF ECG MONITORING. INFORMATION SERVICES WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE LEVEL OF RADIO FREQUENCY POWER THAT WAS ADDED TO THE SPACE TO SUPPORT THE USERS USE OF EPIC. FOR THE ROOM INDICATED, A TOTAL OF 24 TO 25 DBM (250 TO 300 MILLIWATTS) OF POWER WAS USED IN THE 2.4 GHZ AND 5.4 GHZ ISM SPECTRUMS (802.11 A/B/G (B)(6)). ON (B)(6), INFORMATION SERVICES LOWERED THE TRANSMIT POWER SETTINGS OF THE LAPTOPS IN THE ROOM INDICATED TO THE LOWEST SETTINGS AND TESTED THEIR WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY. THEY TESTED BEFORE AND AFTER CHANGING THE POWER AND THEY OBSERVED A 10% INCREASE IN THE OUTBOUND (FROM LAPTOP) CONNECTION SPEED (ABOUT 2 MB PER SECOND), A WONDERFUL RESULT; LOWER POWER AND BETTER SPEED.

2717198	1	SOFTWARE ISSUE IN THE MEDITECH ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM BLOOD BANK MODULE. PREVIOUSLY IN BLOOD BANK BBK RESULT ENTRY, IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR EDITS TO ANTIGEN OR ANTIBODY IDENTIFICATION TEST RESULTS NOT TO FILE TO THE SPECIMEN RESULTS OR BBK HISTORY. THIS OCCURRED IF THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE RESULT STRING FOR THE TEST EXCEEDED 20 CHARACTERS IN THE FORMAT "A=P, B=N, C=P..." WHERE A, B, AND C WERE ANTIGEN MNEMONICS, AND P AND N REPRESENTED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, RESPECTIVELY, OR THE FORMAT "X, Y, Z..." WHERE X, Y AND Z WERE ANTIBODY MNEMONICS AND IF THE EDIT BEING MADE DID NOT CAUSE THE CONTENTS OF THE RESULT FIELD ON THE SCREEN TO CHANGE. WITHIN BBK RESULT ENTRY, ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODY RESULTS WILL BE DISPLAYED ALPHABETICALLY IN A STRING FORMAT WITH IN THE AGID OR ABID RESULT FIELD. BECAUSE OF THE WAY ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODY RESULTS ARE HANDLED, AT A CERTAIN RESULT LENGTH A "..." IS APPENDED TO THE MAIN AGID OR ABID RESULT FIELD TO INDICATE MORE RESULTS ARE PRESENT BUT WILL FIT IN THE FIELD. FOR EXAMPLE, A STRING OF ANTIGEN WOULD DISPLAY AS "A=P, B=P, BG=P..." WHILE A STRING OF ANTIBODIES WOULD DISPLAY AS 'A, A1, AB, ACA, ADD, A..." WHEN NEW ANTIGENS OR ANTIBODIES ARE ADDED TO THESE RESULT STRINGS AFTER INITIAL VERIFICATION, THE CODE WILL CHECK TO SEE IF THIS RESULT STRING HAS CHANGED. IF THE NEW ANTIGENS OR ANTIBODIES BEING ENTERED DO NOT CAUSE THE PREVIOUSLY VERIFIED RESULT DISPLAY STRING TO BE ALTERED -A=P, B=P, BG=P, C=P... - THEN THOSE NEW ANTIGENS/ANTIBODIES WILL NOT BE FILED. IF THE NEW ANTIGENS OR ANTIBODIES DO CAUSE THE PREVIOUSLY VERIFIED RESULT DISPLAY STRING TO BE ALTERED THEN THOSE NEW ANTIGENS/ANTIBODIES WILL BE SAVED. THE MANUFACTURER DID NOTIFY OUR FACILITY THAT THE ISSUE HAS BEEN CORRECTED BY (B)(6) AND A REQUEST HAS BEEN MADE TO CHANGE THE CONTROL ONCE CODING HAS BEEN COMPLETED. OUR FACILITY REVIEWED ALL OF THE PT ANTIBODY FILES FROM (B)(6) 2012, WHEN THE MANUFACTURER STATED THE ISSUE APPEARED WHEN AN UPGRADE TO OUR MEDITECH SYSTEM OCCURRED. WE FOUND NO ERRORS AND ALL ANTIBODY/ANTIGEN IDENTIFICATIONS ARE SHOWING IN THE PT'S HISTORY REPORT. MOVING FORWARD UNTIL THE MEDITECH CORRECTION IS IN PLACE, OUR FACILITY WILL REVIEW/PRINT PT HISTORY WITH ALL ANTIBODY AND ANTIGEN IDENTIFICATIONS AND ATTACH THE PRINTOUT TO THE PAPER PANEL AND FILE IN THE ANTIBODY PANEL BINDER IN BLOOD BANK.

1974716	0	THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR MDR EVAL PROCESS. WE HAVE CHANGED OUR PROCESS TO BETTER ALIGN WITH CURRENT AGENCY POLICY. (B)(6) (CARIDIAN BCT EMPLOYEE) WAS AT A CUSTOMER SITE TRAINING. A TPE PROCEDURE WAS BEING PERFORMED ON A PT WITH TTP. THE CUSTOMER CHOSE TO SET THE AC RATIO AT 15. THERE APPEARED TO BE CLUMPS/CLOTS IN THE FILTER BELOW THE RESERVOIR. FLUID LEVEL IN THE RESERVOIR NEVER WENT BELOW THE LOWER LEVEL SENSOR, BUT THERE APPEARED TO BE LOTS OF TINY BUBBLES WHICH APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE RETURN PRESSURE SENSOR AND GOING DOWN THE RETURN LINE AND INTO THE WARMER LINE THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE RETURN LINE. NO ALARMS OCCURRED. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR AIR TO THE PT. (B)(6). THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR SPECTRA OPTIA TO RETURN SMALL AMOUNTS O AIR TO THE PT THROUGH THE RETURN LINE WHEN THERE IS A SMALL LEVEL OF PLATELET AGGREGATION IN THE RETURN RESERVOIR. THIS AGGREGATION CAN BE CAUSED BY THE USE OF AN INSUFFICIENT LEVEL OF ANTICOAGULATION FOR A GIVEN PT. THE LEVEL OF AGGREGATION MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACTIVATE THE ALARMS DESIGNED TO DETECT THIS CONDITION AT THE CURRENT ALARM LIMITS. A SERVICE CALL WAS PLACED FOR CHECKOUT OF THE EQUIPMENT. RDF ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT WAS PERFORMED. BASED ON THE RUN DATA FILE ANALYSIS AND PICTURES TAKEN DURING THE RUN, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT A PLATELET CLUMP BLOCKED THE LOW LEVEL SENSOR WHILE BEING STUCK IN THE RESERVOIR FILTER. THIS CAUSED THE FLUID TO GO BELOW THE LOW LEVEL SENSOR AND ALLOW AIR TO BE DRAWN INTO THE RETURN LINE. BASED ON AIM IMAGE ANALYSIS, IT IS CLEAR THAT PLATELET CLUMPS WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE CHANNEL. FRESH FROZEN PLASMA WAS BEING USED AS A REPLACEMENT FLUID DURING THIS PROCEDURE AND MAY HAVE CAUSED THE ACTIVATION OF PLATELETS IN THE RESERVOIR. A CLOT IN THE FILTER BLOCKED THE LEVEL SENSOR ENOUGH TO CAUSE AIR TO BE DRAWN INTO THE RETURN LINE. A SERVICE CALL WAS PLACED FOR CHECKOUT OF THE EQUIPMENT. ALL LEVEL AND PRESSURE SENSORS CHECKED OUT WITH NO ISSUES; THE EQUIPMENT PASSED AUTOTEST AND A SALINE RUN WITH NO PROBLEMS. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE OPERATED AS INTENDED.

1477324	1	since the purchase (on 10/16/2007) of multiple ge/corometrics 259cx maternal/fetal monitors, there have been innumerable intermittent problems related to the data entry keyboard (model 2116b). the buffering system built into the fetal monitor to handle communications from the keyboard (which are then sent to a paper strip printed on the 259cx) is overloaded easily, causing the printer to fail, as well as causing display failures (spo2 & nibp measurements fail to display). this intermittent failure occurs most often when multiple parameters are attempting to print at the same time (i.e. automated vs keyboard entries). ge/corometrics have only recently (a few weeks ago) admitted that they will not repair the problem (for the last 2 years, they have led us to believe that a repair was being developed for the failure). this problem only occurs with the 250 series monitors - we have used the older models without failure (116/120 series). the data entry in concern includes point-of-care annotations during bedside care (medications given, pt condition, etc). no injuries have occurred, but the failure occurs most during critical care (i.e. epidural administration), and places the [unmonitored] pt at risk: continuous vitals monitoring may be lost, and restarting the 259cx (to clear the failure) distracts the nurse from their pt care at critical times.

1048324	0	INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: THE CUSTOMER REPORTED DISCREPANT RESULTS GENERATED FOR 3 PT SAMPLES WHEN TESTED USING THE ARCHITECT BHCG ASSAY. THE COMPLAINT TEXT INDICATES THAT THE ANALYZER PERFORMED WELL DURING THE DAY WITHOUT ERROR AND CONTROLS RUN DURING THE DAY WERE ACCEPTABLE. WHEN THE SAMPLE GAVE THE INITIALLY LOW RESULTS, THEY WERE RERUN AND RECOVERED SIMILARLY LOW VALUES, WHICH WERE REPORTED. THE RESULT FOR ONE OF THE SAMPLES WAS QUESTIONED SO THE SAMPLES WERE REPEATED GETTING DIFFERENT VALUES. THE TEXT INDICATES THAT ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS WERE REPORTED THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT AS THE ERROR WAS CAUGHT QUICKLY AND REPORTED TO THE PHYSICIANS QUICKLY. PER THE TEXT ENGINEERING CHANGED THE BUFFER CONTAINER, CHECKED THE PROBES AND DRAIN SENSORS AND THE INSTRUMENT WORKED. THE TECHNICAL MARKETING REP (TMR) ALSO VISITED THE SITE. THE MFR INSPECTED THE INSTRUMENT LEARNING THAT DURING THE NIGHT SHIFT THE TECHNOLOGIST BENT THE R2 PROBE BUT REPLACED IT WITH THE STAT PROBE. THE TMR INSTALLED A NEW REAGENT PROBE, RECALIBRATED BOTH PROBES AND RAN THE CONTROLS. THE MFR ALSO PERFORMED AN INTERNAL DECONTAINATION. THE TMR ALSO RECOMMENDED THE TECHNOLOGISTS RUN CONTROLS EACH SHIFT SAMPLES ARE PROCESSED. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR ARCHITECT ISYSTEM WAS PERFORMED FOR THE TIME PERIOD 2007 THROUGH 2008. THE INSTRUMENT WAS INSTALLED AT THE SITE IN 2008 AND SINCE THAT TIME NO OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE WERE FOUND. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS LOGGED AGAINST EQUIPMENT SUBTYPE 116 AND LN 7K78 WAS PERFORMED FOR THE TIME PERIOD 2007 THROUGH 2008. THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW IDENTIFIED OTHER COMPLAINTS, WHICH DESCRIBE THE ARCHITECT ISYSTEM GENERATED DISCREPANT OR DISCORDANT RESULTS FOR THE ARCHITECT BHCG ASSAY. THE REVIEW DID NOT FIND THAT THE COMPLAINTS IDENTIFIED A DEFICIENCY OF THE PRODUCT OR THAT THE PRODUCT WAS PERFORMING OUTSIDE ITS INTENDED USE. THE EVENT IS ADDRESSED IN LABELING OF THE ARCHITECT TOTAL B-HCG PACKAGE INSERT LN 7K78 (77-4440/R2) INDICATES THAT ADEQUATE LABELING IS PROVIDED RELATED TO THE CUSTOMER'S OBSERVATION. REFER TO THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: QC PROCEDURES INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE. FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES, HCG RESULS SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER DATA; E.G., PT'S MEDICAL HISTORY, SYMPTOMS, RESULTS OF OTHER TESTS, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, ETC. ECTOPIC PREGNANCY CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM NORMAL PREGNANCY BY HCG MEASUREMENTS ALONE. TEN, ELEVEN THE RESULTS FROM THIS OR ANY OTHER DIAGNOSTIC KIT SHOULD BE USED AND INTERPRETED ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL CLINICAL PICTURE. IF THE HCG LEVEL IS INCONSISTENT WITH, OR UNSUPPORTED BY, CLINICAL EVIDENCE, RESULTS SHOULD BE CONFIRMED BY AN ALTERNATE HCG METHOD. THIS MAY INCLUDE THE QUALITATIVE TESTING OF URINE. TWENTY FIVE THE ABSENCE OF URINARY HCG MAY SUGGEST A FALSELY ELEVATED SERUM RESULT. RESULTS MAY ALSO BE CONFIRMED BY PERFORMING SERIAL DILUTIONS OF THE SAMPLE. USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, SAMPLES THAT CONTAIN INTERFERING SUBSTANCES EXHIBIT NONLINEAR RESULTS WHEN DILUTED. THE ABBOTT ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL (PN 201837-104) 2007 INDICATES THE FOLLOWING  OPERATIONAL PERCAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS, 'LIMITATIONS OF RESULT INTERPRETATION' THAT ASSAY RESULTS MUST BE USED WITH OTHER CLINICAL DATA, FOR EXAMPLE, SYMPTOMS, OTHER TEST RESULTS, PT HISTORY, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, INFO AVAILABLE FROM CLINICAL EVAL, AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES. ALL DATA MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR PT CARE MANAGEMENT. IF ASSAY RESULTS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL EVIDENCE, ADD'L TESTING IS SUGGESTED TO CONFIRM THE RESULT. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR ITS INTENDED USE. HOWEVER, ERRORS CAN OCCUR DUE TO POTENTIAL OPERATOR ERRORS AND ARCHITECT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY LIMITATIONS. THE OPERATIONS MANUAL ALSO INCLUDES A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE THAT THE PROBE TIP IS BENT OR DAMAGED UNDER SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS, OBSERVED PROBLEMS 'ERRATIC ASSAY RESULTS (I SYSTEM)'. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE EVENT WAS EVALUATED. A REVIEW OF MECHANICAL AND PERFORMANCE TESTS WAS PERFORMED. LABELING WAS REVIEWED. INTERMITTENT FAILURE OF THE REAGENT PROBE WAS DISCOVERED AND REPLACED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. USE ERROR ALSO MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ISSUE, AS THE CUSTOMER APPEARS TO HAVE REPLACED A REAGENT PROBE WITH A STAT PROBE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE INSTRUMENT. NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. END OF REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT DISCREPANT RESULTS WERE GENERATED FOR PT SAMPLES WHEN USING THE ARCHITECT BHCG ASSAY. (MIU/ML) INITIAL RESULT: <1.20. REPEAT RESULT: 331.3.

THE STAFF TOOK NO ACTION TO ADDRESS THE CRACKED BRAKE COVER AND AS THE PATIENT WAS BEING PREPARED, THE BRAKE HOSE RUPTURED, CAUSING A LOUD NOISE AND RELEASING NITROGEN INTO THE OPERATING ROOM. NITROGEN IS USED TO FILL THE BLADDER BEHIND THE BRAKE COVER WHICH PREVENTS THE EMS FROM MOVING DURING A PATIENT PROCEDURE. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER OPERATING ROOM WHERE THE PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT INCIDENT. NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED TO HOSPITAL STAFF OR PATIENT. A STERIS SERVICE TECHNICIAN INSPECTED THE EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EMS) AND FOUND NO PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEM OUTSIDE OF THE BROKEN BRAKE COVER. THE TECHNICIAN WAS UNABLE TO CHECK THE PRESSURE TO THE SYSTEM AS THE NITROGEN GAS SUPPLY HAD BEEN TURNED OFF TO THE OPERATING ROOM. THE TECHNICIAN REPLACED THE BRAKE COVER AND BRAKE HOSE, AND HAD THE FACILITY TURN ON THE NITROGEN GAS SUPPLY SO THAT THE CORRECT PRESSURE SETTING COULD BE VERIFIED. THE EMS HAS BEEN PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE; NO FURTHER ISSUES HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH THIS EQUIPMENT. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, THE TECHNICIAN FOUND THAT THE EMS PRESSURE REGULATORS IN FOUR OTHER OPERATING ROOMS AT THE FACILITY WERE SET TOO HIGH AND THAT ALL OF THE BRAKE COVERS IN THESE OPERATING ROOMS HAD VARYING SIZES OF CRACKS DUE TO THE HIGH PRESSURE SETTINGS. THE TECHNICIAN ADJUSTED THE NITROGEN PRESSURE IN THESE FOUR OPERATING ROOMS AND THE USER FACILITY HAS REPLACED THE CRACKED BRAKE COVERS.

THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THEY FOLLOWED PROTOCOL INSPECTING THE BOTTLE FOR ANYTHING UNUSUALLY PRIOR TO LOADING, BUT WERE UNSURE IF THERE WERE ANY CRACKS IN THE BOTTLE AT THE TIME OF LOADING. THIS CUSTOMER IS UNSURE HOW THE BOTTLE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE LAB; HOWEVER, THIS CUSTOMER HAD A PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEM TO DELIVER BOTTLES FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR AND THAT MOST BOTTLES ARE SENT VIA THIS SYSTEM. THE SPILL OCCURRED WHEN UNLOADING THE BOTTLE. THE CUSTOMER DID NOT FOLLOW GENERAL LABORATORY PROCEDURE TO WEAR GLOVES PRIOR TO HANDLING THE INOCULATED BOTTLE. PER PACKAGE INSERT INSTRUCTIONS "USE DISPOSABLE GLOVES AND HANDLE INOCULATED BOTTLES CAUTIOUSLY AS THOUGH CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS AGENTS." THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LAB TECH WAS AWARE THE BOTTLE WAS INOCULATED AND BROKEN AND CHOSE NOT TO WEAR GLOVES. THE CUSTOMER FOLLOWED LABORATORY AND BIOMERIEUX RECOMMENDED SPILL PROCEDURE COVERING THE SPILL WITH PAPER TOWELS AND CLEANING THE SPILL WITH 10% BLEACH SOLUTION. NO OTHER BOTTLE BREAKS FROM THIS SN BOTTLE LOT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AT THIS TIME. FOUR SETS OF BLOOD CULTURES WERE TESTED AND RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE FOR HEPATITIS AND HIV. THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT KNOW WHAT DISEASE WAS BEING TESTED FOR THE INOCULATED SN BOTTLE. AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN OPENED TO EXAMINE THE BOTTLE BREAK. A REQUEST TO RETURN THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN MADE AND A BIOHAZARD-SHIPPING CONTAINER HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CUSTOMER. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER BOTTLE BREAK REPORTS FOR THIS LOT. AS THERE ARE NO SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH THIS LOT, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THIS ISSUE WILL REOCCUR. THIS EVENT IS REPORTABLE TO THE FDA AS AN ADVERSE EVENT BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER HAD TO SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT TO DETERMINE EXPOSURE TO THE INOCULATED BOTTLE MEDIA. NO REPORT OF MEDICAL INJURY HAS BEEN RECORDED AT THIS TIME. AT THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT, THE BOTTLE WAS BELIEVED TO BE DISPOSED. UPON FURTHER FOLLOW-UP WITH THE MICROBIOLOGY LAB MGR, IT WAS DETERMINED THE BOTTLE WAS STILL AVAILABLE.

RETAIN AND RETURN SAMPLE INSPECTION: THE BROKEN BOTTLE FROM LOT 1027916 WAS RETURNED FROM THE CUSTOMER TO BIOMERIEUX QA FOR EVAL. THREE HUNDRED RETENTION SAMPLES WERE INSPECTED FOR BOTTLES WITH CRACKS. NO BOTTLES WERE FOUND TO HAVE CRACKS. TO MITIGATE AGAINST LEAKS, THE SN BOTTLE PACKAGE INSERT STATES: "VISUALLY INSPECT BOTTLES BEFORE TESTING. DO NOT USE BOTTLES WITH EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE, LEAKAGE, OR DETERIORATION." IN ADDITION, THE BACT/ALERT 3D USER MANUAL STATES "IF AN INOCULATED BOTTLE IS FOUND TO BE LEAKING OR IS ACCIDENTALLY BROKEN DURING COLLECTION OR TRANSPORT, USE THE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES IN YOUR FACILITY FOR DEALING WITH BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIAL." THE BACT/ALERT 3D SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO LIMIT THE EFFECTS OF LEAKS AS THE USER MANUAL STATES: "EACH BOTTLE CELL WITHIN THE BACT/ALERT 3D INCUBATION MODULE IS SEALED TO HELP CONTAIN AND MINIMIZE EFFECTS OF LIQUID SPILLAGE." THE USER MANUAL ALSO INDICATED THAT, "A DRIP TRAY IS INCORPORATED AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH DRAWER BENEATH THE OPENING END OF THE RACKS TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF ANY SPILLAGE OF LIQUID."

SERVICE WAS DISPATCHED TO TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUE. >< INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: ISSUE: DISCREPANT RESULTS FOR HEMOGLOBIN FOR ONE PT SAMPLE. THE INSTRUMENT IN USE WAS A CELL-DYN 1800 ANALYZER. DAILY QC WAS IN RANGE. THE CUSTOMER WAS UNABLE TO SAY IF THE SAMPLE WAS CLOTTED. THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED A FIELD SERVICE REP (FSR) WHO REQUESTED A FIELD REPAIR ACTIVITY BE OPENED. NO ADD'L DATA WAS AVAIL. THE FSR VISITED 2008, AND VERIFIED THE ISSUE (READING OF HGB FLOW CELL WAS OUT OF RANGE). THE HGB FLOWCELL WAS CLEANED AND ASSOCIATED VERIFICATION PROCEDURES WERE DONE. THE INSTRUMENT WAS PERFORMING TO SPECIFICATION FOR PRECISION AND QC RUNS. THE CELL-DYN SYSTEM 1800 OPERATOR'S MANUAL, 07H80-01, REV D: THE VALUE OF 7.5 G/DL SHOULD HAVE GENERATED A DISPERSIONAL DATA ALERT AS IT IS OUT OF THE NORMAL ADULT RANGE (APPENDIX B, PAGE B-3). PT LIMITS SETS AND PANIC LIMITS CAN BE SET BY THE OPERATOR TO SUIT THE NORMAL RANGES FOUND IN THE POPULATION SERVED BY THE LAB. THE OPERATOR MANUAL RECOMMENDS: THAT ONE PT LIMIT SET OR THE PANIC LIMITS BE USED TO ENTER INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC LAB ACTION LIMITS. A RESULT THAT FALLS OUTSIDE A LAB ACTION LIMIT CAN ALSO INDICATE THE NEED FOR THE OPERATOR TO FOLLOW A LAB PROTOCOL, SUCH AS REPEATING THE SAMPLE, PERFORMING A SMEAR REVIEW OR NOTIFYING THE PHYSICIAN (P 3-25), INACCURATE HGB READINGS MAY BE CAUSED BY CONTAMINATION OF THE HGB FLOW CELL WITH ORGANIC RESIDUE. THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TO CLEAN THE FLOW CELL (PAGE. 10-36). CLEANING THE FLOW CELL IS AN 'AS-REQUIRED' MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY (PAGES 9-35 TO 9-38).

THE INCUBATORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTROLLER CONTAINED CULTURE BOTTLES FROM 172 PHORESIS COLLECTIONS. LOSS OF POWER TO THE CONTROLLER FOR THE CULTURE BOTTLES. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THE POWER TO THE BACT CONTROLLER WAS DISRUPTED CAUSING THE INTERNAL UPS (BATTERY MODE) TO SUPPLY POWER. THE INTERNAL CIRCUITRY FAILED TO ALLOW THE UPS TO SWITCH BACK TO AC MODE WHEN THE MAIN POWER WAS RESUMED. THIS CAUSED THE BATTERY TO BE COMPLETELY DRAINED.

1563960	1	when processing 3-d reconstructions of left atrium for electrophysiology studies and ablation on the leonardo workstation the resolution has been unacceptable to our clinicians.   siemens has recently informed us that the software on this 10 month old workstation is an earlier, lower resolution, version, which captures images every 1.5 degrees. a newer version of the workstation software apparently offers the higher resolution, which captures images every 0.8 degrees, which would be required to process these images adequately on our system. the issue was discussed with staff at the siemens training center in north carolina. according to them, seven months after the install, the low resolution software is no longer available on small detectors like ours because it does not allow for adequate image quality. as this is an adjunctive imaging tool it is not essential to performing the case. atrial fibrillation ablations are usually done without this technology in many centers that have not purchased the system. the goal is to superimpose a three-dimensional shell onto the x-ray screen for better catheter navigation and to guide transeptal puncture, with the hopes of reducing fluoroscopy time and improving patient safety. atrial fib ablations can continue to be safely performed without this technology, we are just not getting the added safety benefit that was the intention of the purchase. instead, by trying to use the technology as intended we are exposing the patient to risk with pulmonary artery catheterization, contrast injection, additional anesthesia time and additional radiation exposure we would not otherwise do in an af ablation, with often unusable results. in these instances there is no benefit to offset this accumulation of small risks.

IN THIS CASE, AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST HAD TROUBLE PLACING AN ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE DURING AN ELECTIVE INTUBATION FOR A PROCEDURE. THUS, THE PT WAS GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS OF "DIFFICULT INTUBATION." THE PT WAS EXTUBATED AFTER THE PROCEDURE, BUT DEVELOPED RESPIRATORY DISTRESS, WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTABLE BASED ON CHEST RADIOGRAPH WHICH WAS EITHER NOT LINKED TO THE EMR OR WAS NOT ACCESSED AND EVALUATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ANY NOTIFICATION THAT IT WAS READY FOR VIEWING, NOR WAS THERE ANY NOTIFICATION THAT IT HAD BEEN EVALUATED BY A RADIOLOGIST. WHEN THE NEED TO REINTUBATE THE PT BECAME URGENT, THE ACUTE CARE TEAM WAS NOT AWARE OF THE DIAGNOSIS "DIFFICULT INTUBATION", AND WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE DIFFICULTY. THE EMR WAS TO HAVE PROVIDED THAT CRITICAL DIAGNOSIS AS A HIGHLIGHTED WARNING AT THE TOP OF THE SCREENS. IT FAILED TO DO SO. THERE WERE NO OTHER WARNINGS.

1054271	0	INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: THE CUSTOMER STATES THE SYSTEM GENERATED DISCREPANT RESULTS WITH THE ARCHITECT BHCG (LN 7K78) FOR ONE PT SAMPLE. THE COMPLAINT INDICATES THAT A BHCG PT SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED IN A GEL TUBE. THE FIELD SVC SPECIALIST CHECKED THE SPEED OF THE CENTRIFUGE, WHICH WAS ACCEPTABLE. THE TEXT ALSO INDICATES THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED ASPIRATION ERRORS IN THE PAST BUT NO OCCURRENCES WERE NOTED ON THE DAY OF THIS INCIDENT. THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SPECIALIST ADVISED THE CUSTOMER TO REPLACE ALL PROBES ON THE INSTRUMENT THEN PERFORM A PRECISION STUDY. THE COMPLAINT TEXT INDICATES THE CUSTOMER WAS TO STOP USING THIS SYSTEM AS THEY WERE INSTALLING AN ARCHITECT I4000 SYSTEM, SO TROUBLESHOOTING WAS NOT COMPLETED. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS LOGGED AGAINST EQUIPMENT SUBTYPE AND LN 7K59 AND LN 7K78 WAS PERFORMED OVER THE TIME PERIOD 10/01/2007 THROUGH 05/19/2008. THE REVIEW DID NOT FIND THAT THE COMPLAINTS IDENTIFIED A DEFICIENCY OF THE PRODUCT OR THAT THE PRODUCT WAS PERFORMING OUTSIDE ITS INTENDED USE. REVIEW OF THE ARCHITECT TOTAL BHCG PACKAGE INSERT INDICATES THAT ADEQUATE LABELING IS PROVIDED RELATED TO THE CUSTOMER'S OBSERVATION. REFER TO THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES, HCG RESULTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER DATA; E.G., PT'S MEDICAL HISTORY, SYMPTOMS, RESULTS OF OTHER TESTS, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS. THE RESULTS FROM THIS OR ANY OTHER DIAGNOSTIC KIT SHOULD BE USED AND INTERPRETED ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL CLINICAL PICTURE. IF THE HCG LEVEL IS INCONSISTENT WITH, OR UNSUPPORTED BY, CLINICAL EVIDENCE, RESULTS SHOULD BE CONFIRMED BY AN ALTERNATE HCG METHOD. THIS MAY INCLUDE THE QUALITATIVE TESTING OF URINE. THE ABSENCE OF URINARY HCG MAY SUGGEST A FALSELY ELEVATED SERUM RESULT. RESULTS MAY ALSO BE CONFIRMED BY PERFORMING SERIAL DILUTIONS OF THE SAMPLE. USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, SAMPLES THAT CONTAIN INTERFERING SUBSTANCES EXHIBIT NONLINEAR RESULTS WHEN DILUTED. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR ITS INTENDED USE. HOWEVER, ERRORS CAN OCCUR DUE TO POTENTIAL OPERATOR ERRORS AND ARCHITECT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY LIMITATIONS. SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS, OBSERVED PROBLEMS ERRATIC ASSAY RESULTS (I SYSTEM) PROVIDES SEVERAL POSSIBLE PROBABLE CAUSES AS WELL AS RESOLUTION FOR THE CUSTOMER'S OBSERVATION, WHICH INCLUDE THE PROBE TIP IS BENT OR DAMAGED AND THE SAMPLE CONTAINS FIBRIN CLOTS OR PARTICULATE MATTER. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS EVALUATED AND ANALYSIS OF LABELING WAS PERFORMED. THE DEVICE WAS FOUND TO BE PERFORMING OUT OF SPECIFICATION DUE TO COMPONENT/SUBASSEMBLY ISSUES. THE CUSTOMER WAS ADVISED TO REPLACE ALL PROBES ON THE ANALYZER AND PERFORM PRECISION TESTING. THE CUSTOMER DECLINED TO FURTHER TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUE STATING THAT THEY HAVE STOPPED USING THE I2000 ANALYZER AND HAVE INSTALLED AN I4000 ANALYZER RESOLVING THE ISSUE. THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION WAS NOT IDENTIFIED. NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. END OF REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT A PT SAMPLE GENERATED DISCREPANT RESULTS FOR BHCG CONCENTRATION.

4637890	0	RECENTLY, THE FACILITY RECEIVED A FIELD SAFETY NOTICE TWO DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE NOTICE REGARDING TWO ISSUES WITH THE MICROTEK MEDICAL SURGICAL DRAPES. THESE TWO ISSUES INCLUDE A CLOUDY/WAXY APPEARANCE TO THE DRAPE AND POTENTIAL TEARS TO THE SYSTEM DRAPES. THESE DRAPES ARE USED WITH THE DA VINCI STANDARD S, AND SI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THE CONCERN IS THAT MANUFACTURER IS REQUIRING THE FACILITY TO PHYSICALLY OPEN EACH STERILE PACKAGE TO INSPECT THE DRAPES PRIOR TO USE. THE MANUFACTURER WILL NOT ACCEPT RETURN OF THE DRAPES UNLESS THE STERILE PACKAGE IS OPENED AND THE DRAPE IS INSPECTED. THIS SITUATION LEAVES PATIENTS POTENTIALLY AT RISK AS ALL OF CURRENT STOCK COULD BE IMPACTED AND THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY GET REPLACEMENT STOCK COULD BE IMPEDED. FDA HAS BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE IMPACTED LOT NUMBERS VIA CORRESPONDENCE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER.

A MDR (3005248192-2010-0002) WAS ALSO FILED ON JULY 02, 2010. THREE POTENTIAL HAZARDS WERE IDENTIFIED: DELAY IN RESULTS. THERE IS NO HARM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HAZARD CHEMICAL EXPOSURE. THERE IS NO HARM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HAZARD AS THIS ISSUE DOES NOT INCREASE THE ALREADY EXPECTED EXPOSURE TO THESE REAGENTS. THEREFORE, THERE IS NO INTRODUCED OPERATOR HARM. SLIP HAZARD. EVALUATION DETERMINED THAT THE OVERALL HEALTH RISK WAS LOW, BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: A. THE OVERALL ESTIMATE FOR A LEAKING BASIN WAS 1.1% (BASED ON BASINS KNOWN TO BE RELATED TO THIS ISSUE) B. LEAKING RATE IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 1 TO 2 DROPS PER MINUTE < 100 UL PER MIN.). WHEN A LOADED BASIN IS EITHER USED IN THE VP2000 OR STORED ON THE LAB BENCH, IN THE TYPICAL USAGE TIME < 8 HOURS), THE LEAKED LIQUID WILL BE LESS THAN 50 ML C. SLIP HAZARD WILL BE AVOIDED BY THE OPERATOR'S OBSERVANCE OF THE LIQUID ON THE FLOOR AND BY THE SMALL VOLUME OF LIQUID. I. IF A LEAK WERE TO OCCUR, IT WOULD OCCUR IN AN AREA THAT A LAB OPERATOR WOULD NOT NORMALLY WALK (IN THE VP2000) OR DURING REAGENT ADDITION (LAB BENCH). IN ADDITION, THE LEAK WOULD BE VISUALLY OBVIOUS TO THE OPERATOR. D. IF THE OPERATOR DID STEP ON THE LEAK, IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO A FALL THAT WOULD LEAD TO A SERIOUS INJURY. >< THE ABBOTT VP 2000 PROCESSOR IS A DEVICE DESIGNED TO AUTOMATE AND STANDARDIZE SLIDE SPECIMEN PROCESSING AND ROUTINE SLIDE STAINING FOR THE LABORATORY.

ROOT CAUSE: A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE REMAINS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE INDICATE THAT THE HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT WAS LIKELY A RESULT OF AN ESCAPE OF WBCS FROM THE LRS CHAMBER DURING A PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT COULD BE DONOR-RELATED. IT ALSO CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THE HIGH NUMBER OF ACCESS ALERTS AND ADJUSTMENTS THAT OCCURRED THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE DISRUPTED THE STEADY-STATE OF THE SYSTEM AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC CONTENT MEASURED IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT A SAMPLING, CALCULATION OR OTHER PROCESS ERROR COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT.

1251184	0	this is an initial report. an investigation is in process. a final report will be submitted when the investigation is complete. >< (b)(4). evaluation, results, (b)(4) (other), labeling information inadequate/incorrect. an investigation was conducted to solve the issue of the occasional high platelets (plt) background counts reported while executing quality control (qc) runs. during subsequent validation testing, elevated red blood cells (rbc) background was also observed. the qc carryover counting flow sequence is the same for cbc test selection which is the most frequent test used by the customer. the increased trend of plt carryover failures during a review of instrument investigation reports for the months of (b)(6) and (b)(6) of 2008 was also observed. the investigation found a design change occurred relative to a predecessor instrument that impacted carryover. this design error allows bubbles that are generated from bubble mixing (agitation by bursts of air pressure) of the specimen solution to extend into the upper surface areas of the rbc/plt mixing chamber that were not intended to be rinsed by design. this occasionally causes plt % carryover performance to exceed specifications. the rbc % carryover is impacted as well for the same reason. it was determined that the carryover performance for plt is less than or equal to 1.7% and for rbc is less than or equal to 1.2%. carryover parameters were not challenged under the cbc test selection during validation and verification and clinical testing prior to product launch. a cell-dyn ruby product deficiency was established for the plt and rbc % carryover parameters that led to field action (b)(4). the communication to customers included modified specifications for carryover to the plt and rbc parameters. the plt and rbc % carryover is less or equal to 1.0% in the cell-dyn ruby system operator's manual. it was recommended to update the carryover labeling claims for plt to 1.7% and for rbc% to 1.2%. this is a final report. >< an in-house software engineer reported that the cell-dyn ruby analyzer has shown  high background counts intermittently on platelet parameter and occasionally on the red blood cells. noc flow error was also displayed under the basophiles result in the run view. it flags invalid numerical results for white blood cells and differential. this issue occurred after running high level of cell-dyn 29 plus control, lot # 80989. no impact to patient management was reported.
1480251	1	the user reported experiencing difficulty obtaining a good ecg waveform with the device, so the user switched to another monitoring device. the user reported that they experienced the same problem with the secondary monitoring device (see report 1051786-2009-00010). while the user was troubleshooting the monitoring devices, it was reported that the pt coded. the pt was successfully revived. the user claimed that the pt was connected to both the primary and secondary monitoring devices at the same time when the event occurred. >< the user facility's biomedical engineer reported to the device manufacturer that he elevated the device and could not find any problems, but was requesting the device manufacturer's assistance in evaluating the device further. the device manufacturer's field service representative traveled to the user facility and evaluated the device involved in the reported event. it was found that the ecg cable used during reported event was physically damaged at the ra and la leads. additionally, the device's wireless spo2 module was cracked, the top of the device's water trap was missing and the wireless module batteries had broken side locking tabs. both the missing top of the water trap and the damaged ecg lead set would be obvious in either any visual inspection or in specified maintenance. the cracked wireless spo2 module and batteries with broken side locking tabs are cosmetic problems only and would not have an impact on product performance. the device manufacturer's field service representative performed operational and functional testing on the device according to internal procedures. all testing was conducted with a new ecg lead wire set and a new water trap. all testing conducted by the device manufacturer's field service representative passed and no malfunction of the monitoring system was detected. the device manufacturer's field service representative consulted with the user facility's biomedical engineer regarding maintenance inspections that, per the instructions for use, should be done routinely on the device as well as on an annual and semi-annual basis. also, in-service training covering basic operation of the device (per the instruction for use) was requested by the user facility and this training was conducted during this site visit as well. in depth application training was also requested by the user facility. this training is currently scheduled to occur in early october. the device manufacturer concludes that the condition of the ecg lead wires was the cause of the device's reported failure to function as expected. use of the user facility's damaged ecg lead wires while attempting to monitor a pt produced an ecg signal/waveform of non-clinical quality. this quality of ecg signal/waveform would have been recognizable, and obvious to the user as incorrect. the device manufacturer believes that the device provided an appropriate response to the deteriorated condition of the ecg lead wires. the device manufacturer does not consider the condition of the ecg lead wires or the poor ecg signal to be a malfunction of the device since the instructions for use provides precautions against the use of accessories that are not in proper working condition. per the instructions for use: cleaning: 'inspect the accessory for any cracks, holes, tears, cuts, etc., that could affect operation, and replace as necessary. 'before connecting to a pt': 'step 3. ensure that all pt accessories being utilized (nibp hoses, cuffs, ecg lead wires, etc.) are listed in the accessories section of this manual. visually inspect all accessories for damage. replace any accessories that show signs of damage or abuse.' the user facility reported to the device manufacturer that the device is back in use. additionally, during their site visit, the device manufacturer's field service representative observed several mri cases with the device in use and no issues were noted. the device manufacturer cannot rule out the use of the device as a contributing factor in the event. while the device manufacturer's field service representative was conducting his site visit, the user stated that they noticed the pt's etco2 reading deteriorating. despite the deterioration in the pt's etco2 reading, the user claimed that they believed that the device's reading was erroneous due to the ecg problems they had been experiencing with the device (as described above). as a result, the pt was not checked; the pt subsequently coded, but was successfully revived.

1083564	1	baxa was notified on 06/25/2008 that a patient had received a tpn bag containing a higher-than-desired quantity of trace elements. the bag was infused for 18 hours and then removed once the issue was discovered. the patient's blood work indicated higher-than-expected levels of zinc and chromium. however, no additional medical intervention was needed. the patient is in stable condition and did not experience any adverse symptoms as a result of the infusion. >< the customer's subsequent investigation revealed that the pharmacist, who entered the subject order within the abacus calculating software, mistakenly entered a value of 3ml/kg of pediatric trace elements in addition to 3ml of adult trace elements. the facilities procedure states that patients should receive adult trace elements and no pediatric trace elements. pharmacist verification of the ordered ingredients failed to identify the additional 84ml of pediatric trace elements. with the assistance of baxa technical support, the importance of abacus software warning limits and ingredients dosing rules were addressed with the customer and a new catastrophic warning limit was created for pediatric trace elements for all pediatric and neonatal patients. this warning limit will notify the user when the value for pediatric trace elements has exceeded the maximum value of 5ml. investigation has confirmed that the abacus calculating software performed as designed and delivered the volume of pediatric trace elements as ordered.
3397073	0	THE TELEMETRY UNITS/BOXES HAVE A DESIGN FAILURE IN THAT THE SLIDE-TOP CLOSURE WHICH ENCASES THE BATTERIES MUST BE MANIPULATED TO ENABLE A CONNECTION. THE BATTERY CONNECTION IS REQUIRED FOR THE PT'S CARDIAC RHYTHM TO SHOW ON THE TELEMETRY MONITORS. THE TELEMETRY TECHNICIANS AND THE NURSES MOVE THE SLIDE-LID BACK AND FORTH UNTIL THE POSITION IS DISCOVERED WHICH ALLOWS THE RHYTHM TO SHOW ON THE MONITOR. OF COURSE, IF THERE IS SUBSEQUENT MOVEMENT OF THE SLIDE-LID, THE CONNECTION CAN BE LOST (WHICH WAS THE CASE IN THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT). THIS WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE SITUATION WAS REPORTED UP TO A NURSING SUPERVISOR, WHO THEN NOTIFIED THE RISK MANAGER. AN INVESTIGATION WAS STARTED. SINCE THE DATE OF THE EVENT WITH THIS PT, 17 ADDITIONAL TELEMETRY UNIT/BOXES HAVE BEEN SENT BACK TO GE. I (WE) ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS ISSUE GOES BEYOND THIS SINGLE PT. IT COULD AFFECT OTHER PTS AS WELL, BOTH WITHIN OUR HOSPITAL AND OTHERS. GE HAD PREVIOUSLY ON ((B)(6) 2013) TESTED 100%OF OUR UNITS/BOXES WITH NO ISSUES FOUND. AND THE RE-TESTING OF THE UNIT/BOX ATTACHED TO THIS PT WAS RETESTED WITH NO FINDINGS. HOWEVER, THEY ARE TESTED ON SIMULATOR AND OF COURSE THE CONDITIONS ARE STATIC WITH A SIMULATOR, WHILE THEY ARE DYNAMIC WITH A PT WHO MOVES, SWEATS, SCRATCHES, ETC (ALL OF WHICH MAY CAUSE MOVEMENT OF THE PARTIALLY OPEN SLIDE-LID). HOWEVER, THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT IS TO MAKE THE FDA AWARE OF A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY. THIS PT HAD HER UNIT/BOX ATTACHED, BUT THE SIGNAL WAS LOST. AND, NOW WE HAVE LEARNED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE UNITS/BOXES. (B)(4).

STAFF COULD TELL FROM THE DISPLAY THERE WAS A PROBLEM, AND CORRECTED THE OBSTRUCTION BEFORE ANY INJURY OCCURRED.THIS APPEARS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE SOFTWARE. WHEN USING THE PCV-VG VENTILATOR MODE, IF THE ET TUBE BECOMES KINKED OR OBSTRUCTED, THE ALARM SEQUENCE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER MODES. ALL OUR AISYS MACHINES BEHAVE THE SAME WAY.IN THE OTHER MODES SUCH AS VCV OR SIMV/PSV MODE, IF THE ET TUBE IS OBSTRUCTED, THE ALARM GOES OFF IN ABOUT 5 SECONDS WITH FLASHING RED ON THE SCREEN AND A RAPID 5 BEEP ALARM EVERY 10 SECONDS. THIS IS HARD TO MISS.IN PCV-VG MODE, IF THE ET TUBE IS OBSTRUCTED, THE FIRST ALARM DOES NOT APPEAR FOR 45 SECONDS, AND IS A SINGLE BEEP WITH 'TV NOT ACHIEVED' MESSAGE, NO FLASHING. AFTER ANOTHER 45 SECONDS, A SECOND ALARM 'MV LOW' AND 3 BEEPS EVERY 30 SECONDS APPEARS. IT IS VERY EASY TO MISS THE SINGLE BEEP OF THE FIRST ALARM.

PER GEHC INVESTIGATION (B)(4), THE SEEDS MAY HAVE BEEN MIXED WITH ANOTHER SEEDS ORDERS, ONE OF 12.43 MBQ (0336 MCI) AND/OR ONE OF 12.58 MBQ (0.340 MCI), RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL RADIATION UNDER-DOSE. TO DATE, NO ADVERSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED TO THE COMPANY FOR THIS PT. THE ORDERED SEED ACTIVITY AND TREATMENT PLAN FOR THIS PT WAS REVIEWED BY THE GE HEALTHCARE MEDICAL GROUP AGAINST THE SEED ACTIVITY IN THE ORDER RELEVANT TO THE POSSIBLE MIX-UP. WORST-CASE SCENARIO, 100% SWAP, WAS ASSUMED AND THE POTENTIAL OVER-DOSE OR UNDER-DOSE CALCULATED. GE HEALTHCARE HAS NOTIFIED THE PHYSICIAN WHO PERFORMED THE SEED IMPLANT IN WRITING AND BY TELEPHONE AND IS FOLLOWING UP FOR FURTHER INFO. EVAL SUMMARY: GE HEALTHCARE QUALITY ASSURANCE INVESTIGATION REPORT (B)(4)/ GE HEALTHCARE WAS MADE AWARE OF A POTENTIAL FOR INCORRECT LOADING OF RAPIDSTRAND RX NEEDLES DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE ON THE PART OF ONE TECHNICIAN AT THE RADIOPHARMACY IN WHICH BRACHYTHERAPY IMPLANTS WERE PREPARED. FOUR INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED IN WHICH SEEDS HAD BEEN SWAPPED BETWEEN ORDERS RESULTING IN INCORRECTLY LOADED NEEDLES (MDR REPORT ID: 2915056-2011-00001, 2915056-2011-00002), OR INCORRECT CALIBRATION STRANDS BEING PROVIDED WITH THE ORDER (MDR REPORT ID: 2915056-2011-00003, 2915056-2011-00006), RESULTING IN MISLABELING OF THE DEVICE. INVESTIGATION OF THESE INCIDENTS AT THE LOADING FACILITY SHOWED THAT THE TECH HAD WORKED ON TWO ORDERS AT THE SAME TIME AND MIXED THE SEEDS BETWEEN THEM. GE HEALTHCARE REVIEWED ALL 173 ORDERS THAT THE TECH COMPLETED DURING EMPLOYMENT AND IDENTIFIED 23 WHERE THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY FOR SEEDS BEING MIXED BETWEEN TWO OR MORE ORDERS. THIS WAS DETERMINED BY IT BEING POSSIBLE FOR THE TECH TO HAVE WORKED ON TWO OR MORE SAME-PRODUCT ORDERS SIMULTANEOUSLY WHERE SEEDS OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITY WERE INVOLVED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED THAT SEEDS WERE MIXED BETWEEN THE ORDERS, ONLY THAT THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS. MIXING SEEDS BETWEEN ORDERS IS PRESUMED TO AFFECT RADIATION EXPOSURE TO THE AREA SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (PROSTATE GLAND, URETHRA, AND RECTUM), EITHER AN OVER-DOSE WHERE HIGHER ACTIVITY SEEDS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE LOADED NEEDLES CARRYING INCREASED RISK OF RADIATION SIDE-EFFECTS, OR UNDER-DOSE WHERE LOWER ACTIVITY SEEDS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE LOADED NEEDLES CARRYING RISK OF SUB-OPTIMAL TREATMENT OF THE TUMOR. THE ORDERED SEED ACTIVITY AND TREATMENT PLAN FOR EACH OF THE TWENTY-THREE PTS WAS REVIEWED AGAINST THE SEED ACTIVITY IN THE ORDER RELEVANT TO THE POSSIBLE MIX-UP. WORST-CASE SCENARIO, 100% SWAP, WAS ASSUMED AND THE CONSEQUENT OVER-DOSE OR UNDER-DOSE CALCULATED. GE HEALTHCARE RISK ASSESSMENT CONCLUDED THAT, FROM A MEDICAL VIEWPOINT, THE RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH AS A RESULT OF A RECURRENCE OF SUCH MISLABELING IS REMOTE.

WHAT DOES ALL THAT MEAN? BASICALLY, THE MONITOR IS SAYING FROM THE READINGS I GATHER FROM THE ORIGINAL PHILIPS AVALON FETAL MONITOR MANUAL: I'M DETECTING SIMILAR MATERNAL AND FETAL HEART RATES. BUT I DETECT YOU ARE USING AN (US) ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER TO PICK UP FETAL HEART RATE BUT NOW I DETECT NO TRANSDUCER -I'M ALSO SUDDENLY DETECTING THAT -TOCO- CONTRACTION EXTERNAL MONITOR TRANSDUCER IS GONE AS WELL =SO I HAVE SWITCHED ON -FMP STATUS- TO DETECT IF THE INFANT IS STILL MOVING.

I SEE IT QUITE OFTEN BUT HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CALCULATED % THAT IS OCCURRING OUT OF THE 200 OF THE 450 STRIPS I WAS ABLE TO REVIEW BEFORE SUBMITTING VOLUNTARY REPORTS TO THE FDA.

3766044	1	THIS REPORT WAS FILED LATE BECAUSE THE INCIDENT WAS INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED AS NOT MDR REPORTABLE. A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS; HOWEVER, IDENTIFIED THIS INCIDENT AS MDR REPORTABLE. AS A RESULT AN UPDATED VERSION OF 6.1.1. OF THE FITTING SOFTWARE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TOGETHER WITH A CUSTOMER LETTER FOR THE ACOUSTICIANS, INFORMING THEM ABOUT THE ERROR ON (B)(6) 2009. THE LOW LIKELIHOOD OF AN OCCURRENCE OF THE PROBLEM IN COMBINATION WITH THE RISK LEVEL DID NOT NECESSITATE FURTHER ACTION. IT WAS DETERMINED AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH SHI AUDIOLOGY THAT CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION IS NOT REQUIRED SINCE THE ERROR ONLY OCCURS UNDER VERY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, AND IN THOSE INSTANCES AN AUDIOLOGY FOLLOWING PROPER FITTING PROTOCOLS WOULD DETECT AND REMEDIATE THE PROBLEM THROUGH 2CM3 COUPLER OR PROBE-MICROPHONE MEASUREMENTS. SECTION 6 OF 2003 AAA PROTOCOL REQUIRES THAT THE AUDIOLOGIST MATCH THE ELECTROACOUSTICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE INSTRUMENT TO THE PRESCRIBED 2CM3 COUPLER TARGET VALUES FOR GAIN AND OUTPUT LIMITING, OR PERFORM PROBE-MICROPHONE MEASUREMENTS. EITHER OF THESE METHODS PRECLUDES AN AUDIOLOGIST FROM FITTING AN INSTRUMENT AFFECTED BY THE INCORRECT CLINICAL FIT ALGORITHM.

THE CUSTOMER ENDED THE PROCEDURE IMMEDIATELY. THE DONOR HAD NO REACTION AT ALL AND THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR WAS NOTIFIED. PER THE CUSTOMER, THE TUBING SET WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR HEMOLYSIS. (B)(4). ANALYSIS OF THE RUN DATA FILE DID NOT FIND A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE HEMOLYSIS REPORTED DURING THIS COLLECTION. NO UNUSUAL PROCESS VARIABLE WAS IDENTIFIED AND TRIMA ACCEL OPERATED AS INTENDED. ON (B)(6) 2010, THE CARIDIANBCT CLINICAL SUPPORT STAFF RECEIVED THE TUBING SET LOT NUMBER FROM THE CUSTOMER AND DISCUSSED WITH THE CUSTOMER THAT OUR RDF ANALYSIS DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ISSUES WITH EQUIPMENT. SERVICE OF THE EQUIPMENT HAD BEEN PERFORMED AS WELL AND THE CUSTOMER WAS SATISFIED. THE CUSTOMER IS CURRENTLY USING THE TRIMA. PER THE CUSTOMER, THE DONOR WAS REPORTEDLY FINE ON FOLLOW-UP FROM THEIR SITE. THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE IF HEMOLYSIS OCCURRED. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS WAS CONDUCTED BY THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATOR IN RELATION TO THIS FAILURE MODE. THERE WAS ONE CSP FAILURE FOR AN UNRELATED MANUFACTURING ERROR THAT WAS RESOLVED PER STANDARD PROCEDURES. ADDITIONALLY, FOR THIS LOT THERE WERE NO PDFS OR PERMIT ECO, NO SUT OBSERVATIONS, AND THE PRODUCT MET ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR RELEASE. CONCLUSION: NO ROOT CAUSE COULD BE DETERMINED AS FROM THE INFO AVAILABLE OUR PRODUCT MET SPECIFICATIONS, ALTHOUGH THE DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. PER INFO FROM THE CUSTOMER, THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS AN RBC SPILLOVER DUE TO THE LIPEMIA. ADDITIONALLY AS THE RDF DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TRIMA OPERATED WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS, A PROCEDURAL ERROR OUTSIDE OF TRIMA MAY HAVE OCCURRED.
5270607	0	AN EVENT OF UNINTENDED MOVEMENT OF ONE DX-D100 UNIT OCCURRED AT THE SITE ON (B)(6) 2015. THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED AGFA AND EXPLAINED WHEN USING THE DX-D100 UNIT IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT OF THE HOSPITAL AND WHILE AN OPERATOR HAD THEIR HANDS GRIPPED ONTO THE UNIT, THE UNIT AUTOMATICALLY TOOK OFF AT FULL SPEED DOWN THE HALLWAY. A STUDENT TECHNICIAN THOUGHT QUICKLY AND HIT THE EMERGENCY BUTTON. NO ONE WAS INJURED DURING THIS EVENT. THE UNIT WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE. AT THE ONSET OF THE EVENT, THE CUSTOMER'S BIOMED SERVICE COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM. AGFA AND OUR SUPPLIER, (B)(4), BEGAN FURTHER INVESTIGATION IMMEDIATELY. THE UNIT WAS THOROUGHLY CHECKED AND ALL REQUIRED UPGRADES, INCLUDING PROPER MOUNTING OF THE RESISTIVE ARRESTOR, HAD BEEN PERFORMED ON THIS UNIT AND THE UNIT HAD BEEN WORKING AS INTENDED, UNTIL THIS EVENT HAPPENED. THE MOVEMENT PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED. DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THE CUSTOMER HAD INSTALLED A METALLIC CHAIN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MACHINE BETWEEN THE FRAME AND THE FLOOR WHICH BYPASSED THE CORRECTION AGFA HAD IMPLEMENTED TO AVOID UNCONTROLLED ESD. THE CUSTOMER THOUGHT BY ADDING THE CHAIN THEY COULD ALSO HELP AVOID ESD DISCHARGES. WITH THE ADDED METALLIC CHAIN, THE RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE FRAME AND GROUND WOULD BE 0 OHMS AND WITH THE RESISTIVE ARRESTOR PROPERLY INSTALLED WOULD BE 1M OHM. DUE TO THIS ADDED CHAIN, THERE WAS NOT ANY RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE FRAME OF THE EQUIPMENT AND ANY METALLIC PART PLACED ON THE FLOOR THAT COULD BE CONNECTED TO GROUND. IF THE EQUIPMENT IS CHARGED WITH HIGH VOLTAGE (ESD), DUE TO THE FRICTION BETWEEN THE WHEELS AND A NON-CONDUCTIVE FLOOR, THE DMC BOARD WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE SPARK PRODUCED IF THIS VOLTAGE IS DISCHARGED TO THE GROUND THROUGH THE CHAIN. UNINTENDED MOVEMENT COULD OCCUR. EVEN THOUGH THE RESISTIVE ARRESTOR HAD BEEN PROPERLY INSTALLED BY AGFA, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY THE CUSTOMER'S INSTALLATION OF THE METAL. THE PROBLEM WAS NOT RELATED TO THE DESIGN OF THE DX-D100 AND THIS EVENT IS AN ISOLATED CASE. THE METAL CHAIN WAS REMOVED FROM THE UNIT BY THE CUSTOMER'S BIOMED DEPARTMENT AND THE UNIT CHECKED BY AGFA. THE ISSUE COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED. THE UNIT WAS PLACED BACK INTO NORMAL USE AND RECOMMENDATION MADE TO NOT INSTALL ANY CHAINS TO THE AGFA EQUIPMENT. THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORTED HARM TO PATIENT OR USER DURING THIS EVENT.><.
2676197	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE, NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(6). THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS (DHR) WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS EVENT. THERE WERE NO EVENTS NOTED IN THE DHR THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. ROOT CAUSE: THIS DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE REMAINS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES WERE PROVIDED IN THE INITIAL REPORT FOR THIS EVENT. AN INTERNAL CAPA HAS BEEN INITIATED TO EVALUATE REPORTS OF ELEVATED WBC COUNTS.><(B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE SIGNALS IN THE RDF INDICATE THAT THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT WAS LIKELY A RESULT OF AN ESCAPE OF WBCS FROM THE LRS CHAMBER TOWARDS THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. THERE ARE NO EVENTS (ADJUSTMENTS, CHANGES IN PUMP SPEED, SUBSTATE CHANGES, ETC.) IN THE PROCEDURE THAT CORRESPOND WITH THE ONSET OF THE OVERLOADING OF THE LRS CHAMBER. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THIS LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE COULD BE DONOR RELATED. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.

ALL LOTS MUST MEET ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA BEFORE RELEASE. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED ELEVATED WBC DATA FOR MULTIPLE PROCEDURES. THE DATA FOR THESE PROCEDURAL EVENTS WAS ANALYZED AS A GROUPING. INVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE RUN DATA FILES (RDFS) IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PROCEDURAL EVENTS, AS LISTED BELOW, THAT MAY HAVE LED TO ELEVATED WBC LEVELS IN COLLECTED PRODUCT. ROOT CAUSE: RDFS FOR THE PROCEDURES WITH HIGH RWBC WERE RECEIVED, INVESTIGATED AND ANALYZED. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVENTS THAT LED TO ELEVATED WBC CONTENT IN PLATELET PRODUCTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND ARE AS FOLLOWS: PRE-PURGE SATURATIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT THE LRS CHAMBER HAS REACHED ITS WBC HOLDING CAPACITY BEFORE EXPECTED BY THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. POST-PURGE SATURATIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT AFTER AN LRS PURGE, THE LRS CHAMBER HAS RE-FILLED WITH WBCS BEFORE EXPECTED BY THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. PLASMA LINE OCCLUSIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT THE PLASMA LINE WAS PARTIALLY OCCLUDED DURING A PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE. THIS CAN CAUSE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, DECREASING THE HOLDING CAPACITY OF THE LRS CHAMBER. OTHER EVENTS - THESE CAN INCLUDE; CENTRIFUGE STOPS, MULTIPLE ACCESS ALARMS AND FLOW ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A NON STEADY STATE CHAMBER CONDITIONS, AND RBC SPILL OVERS WHICH CAN POSSIBLY LEAD TO A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT. ALSO INCLUDED ARE DONOR RELATED CHARACTERISTICS. CORRECTION: A TRIMA SOFTWARE VERSION UPGRADE HAS BEEN COMPLETED AT ALL OF THE CUSTOMER¿S CENTERS. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED DATA GATHERED FROM A TERUMO BCT RECOMMENDED TRIAL OF AVERAGING THE LAST 3 PLATELET COUNTS OF DONORS. THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT USING THE AVERAGE PLATELET COUNT SHOWED A MORE CONSISTENT PROCESS, WHICH WILL REDUCE VARIATION SHOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS RWBC FAILURES.
2087599	0	THE PATIENT'S DUAL CHAMBER MEDTRONIC PACEMAKER WAS SET TO DEMAND PACING ONLY MODE (VVI) AT RATE OF 40 BEATS PER MINUTE DURING A PROCEDURE USING STEREOTAXIS MAGNETIC NAVIGATION SYSTEM (MNS). WHEN THE MNS SYSTEM WAS MOVED INTO NAVIGATE POSITION, THE PACEMAKER WENT INTO "MAGNET MODE" (VOO) ASYNCHRONOUS PACING AT 85 BEATS PER MINUTE. TO PREVENT COMPLICATIONS FROM INAPPROPRIATE PACING, THE OUTPUT WAS DECREASED FROM 2.0 V TO 0.5 V (TO INTENTIONALLY LOSE CAPTURE AND PREVENT PACING). DURING FIRST APPLICATION OF RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) ABLATION, ECG MORPHOLOGY CHANGED TO WHAT APPEARED TO BE PACED BEATS AT ABOUT 130 BEATS PER MINUTE AT HIGHER OUTPUT. WHEN RF ABLATION WAS TERMINATED, THE DEVICE WOULD STOP PACING AND THE PATIENT'S UNDERLYING TACHYCARDIA AT 145 BEATS PER MINUTE WAS SEEN ON ECG. THE PHENOMENON WAS REPEATEDLY REPRODUCED WITH RF APPLICATION. GROUNDING PAD LOCATION WAS MOVED FROM LEFT FLANK TO LEFT THIGH, WHICH INTERMITTENTLY RESOLVED THE ISSUE.

WORKLIST SERVER USED TO IMPORT PATIENT ON MAMMOGRAPHY SYSTEM WAS DOWN, HOWEVER, GE HEALTHCARE ACQUISITION SYSTEM WAS OPERATING PER SPECIFICATIONS, THEREFORE, THE RADIOLOGIST CREATED THE PATIENT'S NAME MANUALLY FOR HER IMAGE REPORT AND THIS HAS RESULTED IN AN INCORRECT PATIENT'S NAME. THE MISLABELED RADIOLOGY REPORT WAS SENT AND ARCHIVED INTO THE PACS SYSTEM. IN (B)(6) 2015 , WHEN THE PATIENT RETURNED FROM THE MAMMOGRAPHY EXAM AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL TO SEE HER SURGEON (THE PATIENT IS PRESUMED TO HAVE TAKEN A COPY OF HER RESULTS TO HER PHYSICIAN/SURGEON), THE SURGEON REVIEWED THE PATIENT'S REPORT AFTER WHICH HE RECOMMENDED AND SCHEDULED THAT THE PATIENT HAVE A REPEAT EXAM AT ANOTHER HOSPITAL ((B)(6)). IT APPEARS THAT THE PATIENT IS NOW BEING TREATED AT (B)(6) (THE POST EXAM TREATMENT IS UNKNOWN). THIS WOULD PRESUME THERE WOULD BE NO TREATMENT DELAY FOR THE PATIENT. IN (B)(6) 2015, THE RADIOLOGIST OF (B)(6) HOSPITAL DISCOVERED THE MISTAKE WHEN HE DID A ROUTINE FOLLOW UP TO SEE WHY THE PATIENT HAD NOT RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL AND NOTIFIED GE HEALTHCARE. THIS TRIGGERED THE RADIOLOGIST TO REVIEW THE MAMMOGRAPHY IMAGES AND THEN THE ISSUE OF THE PATIENT NAME VS IMAGES CAME TO LIGHT WHICH COULD EXPLAIN THE DELAY BETWEEN EXAM DATE AND DISCOVERY OF THE MIX UP. IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE DATE OF BIRTHDAY , PATIENT ID, EXAM DATE CORRESPONDS TO THE PATIENT THEREFORE, THE REPORT CORRESPONDS TO THE PATIENT , ONLY THE NAME IS WRONG. BASED ON THE ABOVE WORKFLOW, GE HEALTHCARE (B)(4) PERFORMED ON MARCH 27, 2015 CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS NO INJURY DUE TO THE WRONG PATIENT NAME SINCE ALL PLANNED EXAMS AND TREATMENT OCCURRED WITHOUT ANY DELAY OR ALLEGED MISDIAGNOSIS. MOREOVER, IF SUCH USE ERROR WERE TO REOCCUR IN ASSOCIATION WITH CORRECT PATIENT IDENTIFIERS, PATIENT DATE OF BIRTH, OTHER IMAGE EXAMS, KNOWN PATIENT HISTORY, PHYSICAL EXAM, AND PATIENT FEEDBACK TO CORROBORATE POSSIBLE PATIENT SYMPTOMS, A SERIOUS INJURY WOULD NOT BE LIKELY. GE HEALTHCARE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. INVESTIGATION ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT THE WRONG NAME IN THE REPORT IS A SITE SPECIFIC ISSUE DUE TO AN OPERATOR ERROR WHEN PATIENT WAS MANUALLY CREATED. THIS ERROR IS OBVIOUS TO THE USER SINCE THE NAME OF THE PATIENT IS DISPLAYED DURING ACQUISITION ON THE IMAGE. GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES UNDERLINE THAT CLINICIANS, RADIOLOGISTS, AND MAMMOGRAPHIC TECHNICIANS ASK THE NAME OF THE PATIENT DURING THE EXAM AND REVIEW OF IMAGES TO CONFIRM THAT THE IMAGES CORRESPOND TO THE CORRECT PATIENT. ALL APPLICATION TRAININGS WERE PROVIDED TO TECHNICIANS AND PHYSICIST.

1245343	1	I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE NURSE REQUESTING MY REVIEW OF THE TRACING IN THE PATIENT'S ROOM.  TRACING CLEARLY SHOWING A DOUBLED FETAL HEART RATE (FHR) WITH NEARLY EVERY CONTRACTION, BEGINNING APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES PRIOR TO MY REVIEW.   FHR BASELINE AT 125BPM.  TRACING RATE DURING CONTRACTIONS APPEAR LIKE INVERTED DECELS STARTING AT 210 AND INCREASING TO 240, OR SIMPLY RECORDING AT 210-240.  FHR WAS AUDIBLE IN THE 110'S.  THE DOUBLING OCCURRED DURING AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CONTRACTION, RAISING THE CONCERN OF WHETHER THE DECELERATIONS WERE LATES.  I WITNESSED SEVERAL OF THESE EVENTS.  THE FETAL MONITOR DISPLAYED AT TIMES A FHR OF 115 THEN JUMPED TO 234 WHILE THE AUDIBILE SOUND WAS SLOWING (CONSISTENT WITH A DECELERATION).  THIS SITUATION OCCURRED IN THE ABSENCE OF MATERNAL MOVEMENT, STAFF INTERFERENCE OR MANIPULATION OF THE ULTRASOUND DEVICE.  THE DISPLAYED FHR IN OBTV WAS NEVER CONSISTENT WITH THE READING ON THE MONITOR DEVICE.  IT WOULD READ 129 WHEN THE MONITOR READ 234 FOR INSTANCE.  THE OBTV DELAY MADE IT APPARENT THAT THE NUMBER ON THE FETAL MONITOR WAS THE ONE TO RESPOND TO.

6002993	0	i had a loop recording device implanted under my skin in my left chest area in order to detect any episodes of atrial fibrillation that may occur while i am asleep. i was given a medtronic mycarelink patient monitor model 24950 to keep by my bedside to receive and forward any a-fib episodes. the 2 instruction manuals that came with the device did not adequately describe how the device worked. the first manual indicated the various displays that the monitor would display during operation with the final picture in the manual showing a large green check mark which i would expect to see if the monitor was functioning properly. the 2nd more detailed manual also showed the various displays the monitor would display during operating with an additional display after the green check mark. this display depicted the status of the internal battery, a picture of a radio antenna with signal strength and a green check mark plus the current date. it also described 3 led lights on the monitor (green, blue and amber) indicating proper operation. in reality the way the monitor works is that after about 5 minutes the display is blank as well as the led lights are turned off. i called medtronic and they stated the blank display indicated everything is operating correctly and there is nothing to worry about. i have 2 problems with this operation. first, nowhere in either manual does it indicate the display will go blank. it just shows the final display inferring that is what the patient will see. second, a blank display indicating proper operation is counterintuitive. i am a retired electrical engineer and have worked with hundreds of shipboard and aircraft displays for the us navy and air force and can guarantee that neither the navy or air force would not accept any display that does not have a positive indication of proper operation. the blank display gives me zero confidence the system is doing anything. i may as well have a brick sitting on my end table.

1668478	0	DURING PUBLICATION REVIEW, WE BECAME AWARE OF A LETTER TO EDITOR PUBLISHED IN RESUSCITATION (VOLUME 80, ISSUE 7, JULY 2009, PAGE 839; COPYRIGHT 2009 ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD). THE AUTHOR (CHRISTIAN VON BARY) DISCUSSES TWO INJURIES - LIVER LACERATIONS AND INTRA-ABDOMINAL BLEEDING NOTICED VIA A CT SCAN AFTER USE OF MECHANICAL CPR DEVICE. THE AUTHOR HAS DESCRIBED THE SITUATION AS PATIENT HAD UNDERGONE RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY. THE PATIENT DEVELOPED PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST, BECAUSE OF WHICH HE COLLAPSED IN THE BATHROOM. THE PATIENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY RESUSCITATED WITH A MECHANICAL CARDIAC COMPRESSION DEVICE. A CT SCAN CONFIRMED PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND ALSO REVEALED LIVER LACERATIONS AND INTRA-ABDOMINAL BLEEDING. THE AUTHOR HAS CITED SOME COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE POTENTIAL CAUSES FOR LIVER LACERATION, INCLUDING: RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY PERFORMED PRIOR TO CARDIAC ARREST AND MECHANICAL CPR; (INJURY RESULTING FROM) PATIENT'S COLLAPSE IN THE BATHROOM; AND IMPROPER PLACEMENT OF THE LOAD-DISTRIBUTING BAND USED WITH MECHANICAL CPR. THE AUTHOR HAS CITED SOME COMBINATION OF TWO DIFFERENT POTENTIAL CAUSES FOR INTRA-ABDOMINAL BLEED INCLUDING; THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY AND MECHANICAL COMPRESSION DEVICE. >< WHILE THE AUTHOR HAS NOT CONCLUSIVELY OFFERED EXACT CAUSE(S) FOR EITHER OF THE TWO INJURIES, IT CLEARS THAT THE USE OF THE MECHANICAL COMPRESSION DEVICE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN RESUSCITATING THE PATIENT. AS PER THE PUBLICATION OF 'THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF RESUSCITATION MEDICINE' - 2ND EDITION (ATTACHMENT B) UNDER THE 'COMPLICATIONS OF CHEST COMPRESSIONS' SECTION, POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS FROM CHEST COMPRESSIONS INCLUDE: RIB FRACTURE, STERNAL FRACTURE, FRACTURE OF CLAVICLES, SCAPULAE AND VERTEBRAL COLUMN, FLAIL CHEST, SKIN TRAUMA, SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA, PULMONARY EDEMA, PULMONARY HEMATOMA, PNEUMOTHORAX, HEMOTHORAX, EMBOLIZATION, LUNG LACERATION, PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM, MEDIASTINITIS, CARDIAC CONTUSION/RUPTURE, PERICARDITIS LIVER LACERATION AND BOWEL INJURIES. PATIENT ANATOMICAL FEATURES AND PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COULD ALSO INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH INJURIES WHEN APPLYING EITHER MANUAL OR MECHANICAL CPR. SINCE THE ALTERNATIVE TO CPR IS DEATH, THE CLINICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE DOES NOT CONSIDER SUCH INJURIES AS SIGNIFICANT.

THE IMAGE AREA (IA) DOESN'T REFRESH PROPERLY LEAVING THE STUDY THAT IS ALREADY DICTATED ON THE SCREEN, WHILE THE TEXT AREA AND PATIENT SLIDER HAVE INFORMATION FROM THE NEXT STUDY. THE POTENTIAL ISSUE IS THAT TWO DIFFERENT PATIENTS CAN POTENTIALLY DISPLAY IN THE IA SIMULTANEOUSLY. EVAL SUMMARY: DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: THIS ISSUE INTERMITTENTLY MANIFESTS AFTER DICTATION OF A STUDY HAS BEEN COMPLETED. WHAT CAN POTENTIALLY OCCUR IS THAT THE TEXT AREA AND THE IMAGE AREA PATIENT INFORMATION HAS UPDATED TO THE NEXT STUDY; HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL IMAGES DISPLAYED REMAIN ON THE PREVIOUSLY DICTATED STUDY.

AFTER A SYSTEM MANIPULATION BY A TECHNICIAN OF THIS THIRD PARTY COMPANY, THE SYSTEM ABOVE STARTED TO ALLOCATE STUDY-INSTANCE-UID'S, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN USED FOR PRIOR PT DATA INFO. THIS MALFUNCTION CAUSED THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE IMAGE DATA SETS WITH NOT UNIQUE STUDY INSTANCE UIDS. THESE INCORRECT DATA SETS WERE SENT, FOR DIAGNOSIS, TO AYCAN'S WORKSTATION OSIRIX PRO AND OTHER WORKSTATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THIS THIRD PARTY COMPANY'S SYSTEM MALFUNCTION INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED IMAGE DATA WAS DISPLAYED WITH INCORRECT PT DATA. DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE MALFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM NO PT OR OTHERS WERE HARMED IN ANY WAY. BECAUSE THE ABOVE DESCRIBED OCCURRENCE IS NOT CAUSED BY OUR SYSTEM, WE BELIEVE THIS MIGHT NOT BE AN OCCURRENCE ACCORDING 21 CFR 803. BUT BECAUSE THIS MALFUNCTION OF THIS THIRD PARTY SOLUTION IS CAUSING OUR SYSTEM TO DISPLAY INCORRECT INFO WE DECIDED TO REPORT THIS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK OF MISDIAGNOSIS.

3058180	0	HEMOCUE (B)(4) HAS REC'D TWO COMPLAINTS CONCERNING THAT HEMOCUE HB 201 WAS MEASURING HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, COMPLAINTS WERE REC'D (B)(6) 2013. NO PT IMPACT WAS REPORTED AN NO MEASUREMENT RESULTS FROM THE HB 201 SYSTEM OR COMPARATIVE METHOD WERE PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMERS. AT THIS POINT, NO MDR WAS NEEDED BASED ON INITIAL RISK ASSESSMENT PERFORMED ON INFO FROM CUSTOMERS. DURING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPLAINTS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE HIGHER MEASUREMENTS WAS DUE TO DEFORMATION OF THE LID OF THE VIAL WHERE THE MICROCUVETTES ARE STORED. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO INCORRECTLY HIGH MEASUREMENT RESULTS WHEN ANALYZING HIGHLY REDUCED BLOOD. THE DEVIATION IN MEASUREMENT COULD BE UP TO +1.1 G/DL AT A HB LEVEL OF 8 G/DL, ACCORDING TO THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. THE INVESTIGATION WAS FINALIZED (B)(6) 2013 AND IT WAS BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM INVESTIGATION THE MDR REPORTING WAS DECIDED. ACCORDING TO THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND CLINICAL IMPACT ANALYSIS, AN INCORRECT MEASUREMENT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A MISSED MEDICAL INTERVENTION, I.E. A BLOOD TRANSFUSION WHEN NECESSARY. HOWEVER, IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO OCCUR SINCE IT ONLY AFFECTS VENOUS BLOOD SAMPLES WITH EXTREMELY LOW OXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN. IT IS RARE THAT A BLOOD TRANSFUSION IS INITIATED BASED ON A SINGLE POINT-OF-CARE HEMOGLOBIN MEASUREMENT RESULT, BUT IT COULD OCCUR IN SURGERY ROOM ON PTS WITH MASSIVE BLEEDING. A ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION OF THE DEFORMATION OF THE LID ON THE IDENTIFIED UNITS IS ONGOING. EVAL SUMMARY: PROBLEM DEFINITION FOR INVESTIGATION (CUSTOMER COMPLAINT): THE HEMOCUE HB (B)(4) MEASUREMENT RESULTS WERE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WHEN TESTED WITH A MICROCUVETTES FROM THE VIAL. THE CUSTOMER FOUND THAT THE LID WAS DEFORMED. INVESTIGATION: REVIEW OF BATCH DOCUMENTATION (DHR): NO DEVIATIONS FOUND. RESULTS FROM INVESTIGATION (PRODUCTION): THE DAMAGE PROBABLY OCCURRED WHEN THE LID WAS MOUNTED ON THE VIAL. RESULTS FROM THE INVESTIGATION (PRODUCT SUPPORT SYSTEM): THE INNER PART OF THE LID IS PARTLY DEFORMED. CONCLUSION: THE HIGHER MEASUREMENT RESULTS ARE PROBABLY DUE TO THE DEFORMATION OF THE LID OF THE VIAL. ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION IS HANDLED WITHIN A CAPA.
5929494	0	i used the omnipod insulin pump. there is an adhesive that is used to attach the pod to various places on your body. my last shipment came about 6 weeks ago, and at that time i started having reactions to the site, redness, itching, raised skin, blistering with weeping. when i called omnipod, they sent some replacements pods and when i started using them, the reactions got worse. when i called omnipod again to report the problem for the second time, they were not helpful at all and said there was no problem with their product and they had not changed anything. even though the problem started with the first pod out of the new shipment. their solution is to put other products, other adhesives on top of the product i'm having trouble with, it's getting to the point where i can't use them anymore.

DESPITE COATED NEEDLES AS WELL AS RINSING STEPS, SUCH A PHENOMENON MAY OCCUR IN VERY RARE CASES, IS USUALLY BASED ON A SAMPLE-SPECIFIC REACTION AND CAN BE CAUSED BY A HIGH PROTEIN LEVEL IN PLASMA (INDUCED BY SEVERE SICKNESS OR APPLICATION OF DRUGS) OR ANTIBODIES WITH A HIGH TITRE. SINCE ANY SPECIMEN BEING CONSPICUOUS DUE TO A POSITIVE ABS RESULT SHOULD UNDERGO RETESTING AND BECAUSE ANY ABS-POSITIVE SAMPLE FROM A BLOOD DONOR SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM TRANSFUSION, NO SERIOUS THREAT NEITHER FOR PT NOR USER OR DEVICE MAY ARISE DUE TO A CARRY-OVER EVENT. IN ACCORDANCE TO THE RESULTS OBTAINED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE, TESTING AT BMD CONFIRMED A CARRY-OVER EVENT FROM ONE WELL INTO THE FOLLOWING ONE OCCURRING DURING SEQUENTIAL PIPETTING OF DIFFERENT BLOOD PLASMA CAUSED BY THE HIGH TITRE OF ANTIBODY PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE. EACH PIPETTING STEP OF INDIVIDUAL SAMPLES IS FOLLOWED BY A RINSING STEP OF THE CORRESPONDING NEEDLE RESULTING IN A DILUTION OF BIOLOGICAL RESIDUES BY APPROX. 1:1000.

885662	0	THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. FOUR CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT CAN LEAD TO A STOP OF THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH), WHEN THE SAMPLE IS PRESENTED TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE FOR ASPIRATION: REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM A ROUTINE BAY WHILE THE ACCESS INDICATOR IS AMBER; - OPENING AN RSH COVER WHILE THE RSH IS IN THE RUNNING STATE; - USER REQUESTING STOP EITHER ON THE RSH KEYPAD OR FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN ON THE SYSTEM CONTROL CENTER; - A NON-RECOVERABLE HARDWARE FAILURE OF AN RSH MECHANISM. INVESTIGATION OF THE ISSUE DISCOVERED A TIMING-DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY-REMOVAL DOES NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CLINICAL CHEMISTRY MODULE. THIS CONDITION CAUSES THE MODULE TO RECEIVE AN ERRONEOUS SAMPLE ARRIVAL FOR TESTS/SAMPLES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DELETED, WHEN THE RSH NOTIFIED THE C8000II.DLL OF THE TRAY REMOVAL ERROR CONDITION. AFTER A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY, THE MODULE SENDS AN EQUALLY ERRONEOUS SAMPLE FREE MESSAGE THAT CAUSES THE RSH TO INDEX THE CARRIER TO THE NEXT POSITION. AT THAT POINT, THE SEQUENCE OF SAMPLING IS OFF BY ONE CARRIER POSITION. THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED IN SOFTWARE VERSION 3.00 FOR THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM, BUT ALL SOFTWARE VERSIONS THAT SUPPORTED AN INTERFACE TO THE C8000 AND/OR THE C16000 AND RSH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS ISSUE (V2.00, V2.01, V2.02, V2.03, V2.10, V2.11, V2.20, V2.20 DB UPDATE, V2.60, V2.30, V3.00 AND V3.10). THE ISSUE CAN OCCUR ON THE C8000 AND C16000 SYSTEMS SINCE THE RSH AND THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE (C8000II.DLL) ARE COMMON TO BOTH CONFIGURATIONS. THE ISSUE WAS FOUND TO BE DUE TO A TIMING- DEPENDENT DEFECT, WHERE THE TRAY REMOVAL WOULD NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE. LABELING: THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL CONTAINS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE USE AND FUNCTION OF THE RSH IN SECTION 1. STATUS INDICATORS INDICATES THE STATUS OF SAMPLE PROCESSING AND WHEN THE OPERATOR CAN ACCESS SAMPLES. A STEADY AMBER LIGHT INDICATES THAT SAMPLES ARE PROCESSING AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED. SECTION 5: OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS; SUBSECTION: SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PROVIDES PROCEDURES FOR LOADING SAMPLES ONTO THE RSH FOR PROCESSING. THE PROCEDURE 'ACCESS A SAMPLE WITH TESTS IN PROCESS' ADVISES THE OPERATOR TO PERFORM THIS PROCEDURE TO SUSPEND A BAY ON THE RSH, WHEN IMMEDIATE ACCESS IS NEEDED TO A SAMPLE THAT IS BEING PROCESSED. IMPROPER REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM THE RSH WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE ERROR CODE 0273 (REMOVAL FROM THE PRIORITY BAY) OR 0274 (REMOVAL FROM THE ROUTINE BAY). THE STOPPED STATUS FOR THE RSH IS DESCRIBED IN TABLE 1.3. CONDITIONS FOR THE RSH TO BE STOPPED INCLUDE:- THE OPERATOR HAS SELECTED F6- STOP FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN OR THE STOP KEY ON THE SAMPLE HANDLER KEYPAD;- ONE OF THE RSH COVERS WAS OPENED WHILE THE SAMPLE HANDLER WAS RUNNING;- SAMPLE HANDLER DETECTED A FATAL ERROR WHILE PROCESSING. THE OPERATOR IS ADVISED IN SECTION 7: OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TO 'KEEP ALL PROCESSING MODULE AND SAMPLE HANDLER DOORS CLOSED AND COVERS IN PLACE UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE IN A MAINTENANCE OR TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE' WHILE OPERATING THE SYSTEM. OPENING A COVER DURING OPERATION WILL RESULT IN THE GENERATION OF ERROR CODE 0709, RSH STOPPED, COVER OPENED. TROUBLESHOOTING ASSISTANCE FOR ALL ERROR CODES IS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS. >< THE CUSTOMER STATED, TEST RESULTS ON THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, SAMPLE 1 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 2, SAMPLE 2 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 3, ETC. THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) GENERATED ERROR CODES 0274, TRAY IN BAY (X) WAS REMOVED BEFORE ACCESS WAS GRANTED, AND 0526, EMPTY TRAY DETECTED IN BAY (X), INDICATING THAT THE OPERATOR HAD INAPPROPRIATELY REMOVED A TRAY FROM THE RSH. CODE 0304, TRANSPORTER ERROR ALSO OCCURRED. THE RSH WENT TO STOPPED STATUS WHILE THE PROCESSING MODULE REMAINED IN RUNNING. THE OPERATOR ORDERED RERUNS FROM THE EXCEPTION SCREEN AND BEGAN TO RUN AGAIN. THE OPERATOR SUSPECTED AN ABERRANT RESULT ON A SAMPLE AND STOPPED THE RUN. REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE RESULTS WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. SAMPLE #7 HAD THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE #8. THE OPERATOR FOUND 28 CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES THAT WERE AFFECTED. THIRTEEN OF THE RESULTS HAD ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE DOCTOR, BUT NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED.
5330646	0	THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE ARCHITECT ANALYZER GENERATED SAMPLE PRESENTATION AND SAMPLE QUEUE ERRORS ON A PATIENT SAMPLE ((B)(4)) ON THE AMS (OMNILAB MIDDLEWARE) BUT NOT ON THE ARCHITECT ANALYZER. THE ARCHITECT TOOK SAMPLE FROM ONE TUBE WHILE A DIFFERENT TUBE WAS EXPECTED TO BE SAMPLED AND THE RESULTS DID NOT GO TO EXCEPTIONS. THE RESULTS GENERATED WERE FOR FOLATE - INITIAL 6.9 / REPEAT 3.3. THERE WAS NO REPORTED IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT. THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL PATIENT INFORMATION PROVIDED.><(B)(4). AN EVALUATION IS IN PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE EVALUATION IS COMPLETE.><AN EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED BY REVIEWING THE COMPLAINT TEXT, OTHER CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS FOR SIMILAR ISSUES, REVIEW OF LABELING, AND REVIEW OF HISTORICAL DATA. ERROR CODE 8276 SAMPLE PRESENTATION ERROR WAS REPORTED TO HAVE OCCURRED ON ARCHITECT SYSTEM (B)(4). REVIEW OF LOGS BY OMNILAB (MANUFACTURER OF THE AMS MIDDLEWARE) NOTED THAT ONE OF THE ARCHITECT INSTRUMENTS SENT ERROR 8276 FOR SAMPLE (B)(4), AND AMS RULES PROPERLY MANAGED THE ERROR. SAMPLE PRESENTATION (SPE) AND SAMPLE QUEUE (SQE) ERROR WAS GENERATED ON (B)(4) (FOLATE TEST) ON THE APS I2000SR INTERFACE MODULE A WEEK LATER. THE ERROR WAS SEEN IN THE AMS MIDDLEWARE ONLY, NO ERROR WAS FOUND IN THE MESSAGE HISTORY OF ARCHITECT (B)(4) OR IN THE APS HISTORY. WHEN A SAMPLE MOVES INTO POSITION FOR TESTING, THE SAMPLE CARRIER ID IS READ, TESTS ARE ASPIRATED, AND THE CARRIER ID IS READ AGAIN BEFORE THE SAMPLE IS RELEASED. IF THE INITIAL AND FINAL READS DO NOT MATCH, THE FIRST SAMPLE GENERATES THE PRESENTATION ERROR AND THE SECOND SAMPLE GENERATES THE QUEUE ERROR. THESE ERRORS ARE GENERATED BY THE APS SYSTEM. SAMPLE PRESENTATION ERRORS DUE TO ERROR CODE 8275 / 8276 ARE GENERATED BY THE ARCHITECT. THESE ERRORS OCCUR AS A RESULT OF ISSUES WITH THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE APS AND ARCHITECT SYSTEMS. FIELD SERVICE REPLACED A MOTOR, PART NUMBER 8-203835-01, WHICH INTERMITTENTLY FORCED PUCKS PAST THE SAMPLE GATE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. NO ISSUES WITH THE APS COULD BE IDENTIFIED. THE RESULT LOG FOR ARCHITECT I2000SR SN (B)(4) CONFIRMED THAT (B)(4) WAS RUN ON (B)(6) 2015 AT 13:57 AND 18:10, NO ERROR MESSAGES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAMPLE AND NO ERRORS WERE FOUND IN THE HISTORY LOG. A REVIEW OF TICKET HISTORY FOR THE ANALYZER DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CURRENT COMPLAINT. THERE WAS NO TREND IDENTIFIED FOR MOTOR, PART NUMBER 8-203835-01, OR FOR THE APS SYSTEM RELATED TO THIS ISSUE. A REVIEW OF THE ARCHITECT AND APS OPERATIONS MANUALS DESCRIBES PROBABLE CAUSES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR SPE AND SQE ERRORS. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF SPE/SQE ERRORS OR ERROR CODE 8275/8276, FOUND THE ERRORS WERE ADDRESSED BY REPLACING OR ADJUSTING VARIOUS PARTS AND RERUNNING SAMPLES AS NECESSARY. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, A DEFICIENCY WAS NOT IDENTIFIED. ERROR MESSAGES WERE PROPERLY GENERATED TO ALERT THE OPERATOR.

1232005	1	IN 2008, THE STAFF AT THE HOSPITAL  DISCOVERED A TELEMETRY PT SLUMPED IN TOILET AREA IN CARDIAC ARREST. THE STAFF RESUSCITATED THE PT AND TRANSFERRED TO INTENSIVE CARE. THE STAFF ALLEGED THAT NO PRIORITY ALARM WAS SOUNDED DESPITE VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION BEING OBSERVED ON CARDIAC MONITOR. THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO MHRA AND FORWARDED TO SPACELABS IN 2008. >< THIS INCIDENT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO MHRA 10 DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. SPACELABS FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT THROUGH THE INFO FORWARDED BY MHRA. THE HOSPITAL REPORTED THAT THEY TESTED THE DEVICE AND TELEMETRY CHANNEL AFTER THE INCIDENT AND BEFORE THE DEVICE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SVC. THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICAL ENGINEER WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY TRIGGERED ALL ALARM CONDITIONS. SPACELABS RESPONDED BY VISITING THE HOSP WITHIN 24 HOURS OF BEING NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT. SPACELABS CONDUCTED SIMULATOR TESTING OF THE SUSPECT DEVICE, AND ALL OTHER SIMILAR TELEMETRY DEVICES. SPACELABS TESTING DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL EQUIPMENT WAS OPERATING TO SPECS, ALL ALARMS WERE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. SPACELABS WAS NOT ABLE TO REVIEW ANY RELEVANT ALARM OR HEART RATE RECORDS AS THE HOSP HAD THE PRINTER OFF DURING THE INCIDENT. SPACELABS DID ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE IF THIS INCIDENT WAS RELATED TO THE CURRENT TELEMETRY FIELD CORRECTIVE ACTION. OUR INVESTIGATION WAS INCONCLUSIVE. THE CONDITIONS BEING ADDRESSED IN THE RECALL ARE A FAILURE OF THE TELEMETRY RECEIVER'S ALARM FUNCTION THAT IS ONLY CORRECTABLE BY REMOVING POWER FROM THE RECEIVER MODULE FOR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES. DUE TO THE 10-DAY DELAY IN BEING NOTIFIED OF THIS MATTER, WE ARE UNABLE TO ABSOLUTELY CONFIRM THAT THE RECEIVER HAD NOT BEEN RESET. ALL TESTING DID CONFIRM THAT ALARMS WERE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY SET. ALL TESTING DID CONFIRM THAT ALARMS WERE FUNCTIONING. NO FURTHER ACTION IS ANTICIPATED.

2450140	1	THE TELEMETRY BOX WAS SENT DOWN WITH A BURNED BATTERY COMPARTMENT (INTERIOR ONLY) AND BURNED BATTERIES. THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT HAS A LOT OF BURN RESIDUE AROUND THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL CONNECTORS. THE BATTERIES HAD OVERHEATED TO THE POINT THAT THE PLASTIC LABEL COVER ON THE BATTERY BLISTERED AND STARTED PEELING AWAY FROM THE BATTERY CELL. THE BATTERIES APPEARED TO BE INSTALLED CORRECTLY DUE TO WHERE THE BURN MARKS WERE ON THE BATTERIES AND BATTERY COMPARTMENT. I CAN'T TELL IF THEY WERE BOTH REMOVED AND REINSTALLED IN THE SAME ORDER AS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED. I DID INSTALL THE ORIGINAL OVERHEATED BATTERIES IN THE TELE BOX AND "THE ON BOTH BATTERIES AND THEY TOUCHED BY THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL SIDE." A NEW TELEMETRY BOX WAS SIMULATED WITH THIS CONDITION WHILE ADMITTED AND RUNNING AT A CENTRAL. THE BATTERIES CAN BE SHORTED, WHILE STILL SHOWING A WAVEFORM ON THE CENTRAL, WITH THE BATTERY DOOR CLOSED. THE BATTERIES WILL OVERHEAT WITHIN 10 MINS TO THE POINT THEY START SMELLING AND COULDN'T BE TOUCHED. THE TEST WAS STOPPED BEFORE ANY DAMAGE TO THE BOX OCCURRED. AFTER EVALUATING THE (B)(4) TELEMETRY BOX, THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS CAUSE FOR THIS CONDITION. INSTALLING THE BATTERIES BACKWARDS IS POSSIBLE BUT THE WAY THE COMPARTMENT IS DESIGNED, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE A COMPLETED CIRCUIT. THERE IS NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE COMPARTMENT THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT IMPROPERLY INSTALLED BATTERIES COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN. THE NEXT STEP WAS TO CLEAN THE RESIDUE AWAY TO SEE WHAT'S UNDER IT. AFTER CLEANING THE RESIDUE AWAY, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT LOOKED PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH THE BATTERY CONTACTS OR THE COMPARTMENT. COMPARING THE DEFECTIVE TRANSMITTER TO A NEW TELEMETRY BOX, THE NEW BOX HAS NO VOLTAGE ACROSS ANY BATTERY TERMINAL (WITH BATTERIES REMOVED).

SPECIFICALLY: INCORRECT MEASUREMENT METHOD BEING POPULATED IN FINDING SENTENCE: THE FINDING SENTENCE REFERRING TO AVA BY PLANIMETRY HAS BEEN CHANGED TO IMPORT THE AVA MEASURED BY VTI. POTENTIAL IMPACT: AN INCORRECT METHOD FOR OBTAINING TO AVA WILL BE IMPORTED, LEADING TO A POTENTIAL INCORRECT AREA BY VTI. THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORTED PATIENT HARM FOR THIS OCCURRENCE. A REPORTABLE CORRECTION IS UNDERWAY FOR THIS ISSUE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE FDA VIA REFERENCE #Z-2112-10. AGFA WILL FOLLOW THE RMAT POST MARKET VERIFICATION WORK INSTRUCTIONS TO CORRECT THE SENTENCE FINDING. ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION FOR THE SITE DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT WILL BE DOCUMENTED IN THE ONGOING CFR PART 806 REPORTING. (B)(6).><AGFA SUBMITTED MDR REPORT #1225058-2010-00001 TO THE FDA ON JUNE 7, 2010 FOR A SITE IN THE US. A 13TH OCCURRENCE IS BEING REPORTED FOR THE SAME ISSUE/SAME DEVICE: IMPAX CV RESULTED MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION TOOL (RMAT). THIS IS AN INTERNAL DISCOVERY DETERMINED DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ASSOCIATED PROBLEM CORRECTION PLAN, RMAT VERIFICATION, AS REPORTED IN FDA Z-2112-10. WITHIN THIS 13TH OCCURRENCE ARE 28 DIFFERENT STUDY DATES IN WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL MDR REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EACH ASSOCIATED STUDY DATE AND MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER (MRN). CURRENTLY, 30 REPORTS CONTAIN THIS INCORRECT FINDING INFORMATION.
3229546	1	IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN A TREATMENT PLAN WITH MULTIPLE ISOCENTERS IS CREATED AND TRANSFERRED TO MOSAIQ, ALL FIELDS ARE MERGED INTO ONE ISOCENTER. THERE WAS NO WARNING OF THIS ACTION. THERE WAS NO PT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. NO FURTHER INFO WAS REPORTED.

1124467	0	operator experienced discrepant urine creatinine results when one pt sample was aliquoted by the mpa versus manual placement of the sample onto the same analyzer. initial result 0.36, repeat 60.86, units of measure not provided. erroneous result was not reported. the field service rep was unable to determine root cause. performance tests were performed.
1105836	0	a possible root cause was determined. an ocd field engineer arrived on site and indicated that the customer had reported observing fluid coming from the handler. the fe determined the probe was crashed within the handler. replacement of the probe and the appropriated adjustments to the drive motor belt and lubrication to the screw and bearings has returned to instrument to expected operation. this customer has not logged any similar complaints against this analyzer since this incident. >< the customer reported observing moisture residue in the ortho provue analyzer and on top and underneath the waste container. the customer also noticed dried wash solution on the analyzer. no erroneous result or contamination occurred as a result of this incident. fluid leak or probe issues can lead to dilution of reagent/sample, carry over/cross contamination from microtube to microtube, erroneous test results and transfusion of incompatible blood.
5262297	1	PLEASE SEE INITIAL REPORT.><THE INVESTIGATION WAS STARTED BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN CONCLUDED. THE INVESTIGATION RESULT WILL BE REPORTED IN THE FOLLOW UP-REPORT.><THE AFFECTED M540 AND LOG FILES FROM THE DAY OF THE EVENT WERE PROVIDED TO DRÄGER FOR THE INVESTIGATION. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A HARDWARE FAILURE IN THE LOG FILES. LOG ENTRIES SHOW THAT THE SPEAKER VOLUME WAS HELD AT 50% FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE DAY EXCEPT AT 11:29, WHEN THEY WERE INCREASED TO 100%. ABOUT 40 SECONDS PRIOR TO INCREASING THE VOLUME TO 100%, THE USER INITIATED AN AUDIO PAUSE EVENT. AUDIO PAUSE SUPPRESSES ALL AUDIBLE ALARMS FOR TWO MINUTES OR UNTIL THE AUDIO PAUSE BUTTON IS PRESSED AGAIN. ANY CHANGE OF SPEAKER VOLUME DOES NOT AFFECT THE AUDIO PAUSE TIME. THERE WERE SEVERAL AUDIO PAUSE EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE REPORTED DATE OF THE EVENT. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED IF THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE LACK OF AUDIBLE ALARM AS THE TIME OF THE EVENT WAS NOT REPORTED. A FULL SYSTEM TEST WAS PERFORMED TO CHECK ALL FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE AFFECTED M540 INCLUDING AUDIO TESTS. IT PASSED ALL TESTS AND THERE WERE NO ISSUE WITH THE SPEAKER. REPORTEDLY THE M540 WORKED CORRECTLY AFTER BEING RESTARTED BY THE USER. NEITHER THE LOG FILES NOR THE AFFECTED M540 INDICATED A DEVICE MALFUNCTION FOR THE REPORTED DATE OF EVENT. THE REPORTED PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED. DUE TO THIS A PRECISE ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE M540 INCLUDES A SPEAKER AUDIO-TEST DURING STARTUP FOR USER CONFIRMATION OF PROPER OPERATION OF THE DEVICE AND THE IFU FURTHER INSTRUCTS THE USER ON HOW TO VERIFY AUDIO TONES. VISUAL ALARMS WILL STILL CORRECTLY BE DISPLAYED ON THE M540 TO INFORM THE USER. IN A NETWORKED ENVIRONMENT THE CENTRAL STATION WILL ADDITIONALLY ALARM VISUALLY AND AUDIBLY. RISK ANALYSIS WAS REVIEWED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE NO NEW OR REVISED RISKS.><IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN AN ALARM OCCURS THERE WILL BE NO ALARM SOUND AT THE M540. EVEN IF THE ALARM IS SET AT 100% VOLUME, THERE IS NO ACOUSTIC WARNING. THE CORRECT MESSAGE AND THE ALARM ARRIVE AT THE CENTRAL STATION AND IT ALARMS VISUALLY AND ACOUSTICALLY. THE ERROR COULD BE CORRECTED BY RESTARTING THE M540.

AFTER CHECKING THE EQUIPMENT, IT APPEARED THAT THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES WERE REPETITIVE. SOME TIMES THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM COULD BE USED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS, AND OTHER TIMES IT COULD NOT UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS. THE SYSTEM WAS TESTED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SAME ROOM WITH KNOWN WORKING GENERATORS (THE GENERATORS WERE INTERROGATED BY AN ALTERNATE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM AND THEREFORE WERE KNOWN TO BE WORKING). ATTEMPTS TO ISOLATE THE MALFUNCTIONING UNIT, BETWEEN THE WAND AND HANDHELD, WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. AS THE SITE HAS AN ALTERNATE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM, PRODUCT ANALYSIS OF THE WAND (REPORTED IN MFR #: 1644487-2012-02849) INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO ANOMALIES AND IT WAS WORKING CORRECTLY. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS VERIFIED. DURING THE ANALYSIS, 2 ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE DEVICE PERFORMANCE. THE FIRST ANOMALY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MISSING BATTERY COVER. WITHOUT THE BATTERY COVER, THE HANDHELD WILL NOT POWER ON. THE SECOND ANOMALY IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DAMAGED 120V POWER CORD. AN ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THAT THE 120V POWER CORD THAT PROVIDED POWER TO THE AC ADAPTER WAS DAMAGED AND NOT MAKING ELECTRICAL CONTACT. THE CAUSE FOR THE DAMAGE TO THE CORD IS ASSOCIATED WITH MISHANDLING. ONCE THE BATTERY DOOR AND 120V CORD WERE REPLACED, NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE.

sa bottles and that their erp system would not allow the user to enter a generic barcode. as a result, they were unable to enter the blood culture samples or create records in the laboratory information system (lis). the customer reported having to send samples to another facility where a workaround in the erp system is being performed; however, this has the potential to cause result delays. an internal biom?rieux investigation was performed related to this issue. the bact/alert? bottle label supplier (ccl) was notified that biom?rieux had received a complaint for a duplicate bottle id number. ccl indicated the numbers were generated by a biomerieux-supplied software. the numbers are 100% scanned by ccl for no read, no scan, poor quality, and to ensure there are no duplicated bottle id numbers within the set. as part of the ccl investigation, the numbers reported as duplicate were compared to a database of bottle id numbers ccl had generated prior to biom?rieux supplying the bottle id numbers. the reported bottle id numbers were confirmed to have been previously issued. ccl concluded the root cause was that biom?rieux had supplied bottle id numbers identical to numbers ccl had historically generated. a retain label analysis" by biom?rieux confirmed ccl's conclusion on september 12  2016. further analysis of equipment configurations concluded "bact/alert? connected to observa?" or "bact/alert? connected to bact/view" could allow the result for a previous patient to be assigned to a new patient. however  investigation determined it is not likely that bact/alert? connected to observa? will impact results since the workflow delays linking the culture bottle to the patient record. in each case  the correct result will be assigned to the new patient record upon completion of the bottle test. in addition  clinical environment mitigations decrease the likelihood of an erroneous result going unnoticed. clsi guidance m47-a  principles and procedures for blood cultures  regarding the required number of blood culture bottles indicates "a single culture bottle is clearly inadequate ..... multiple sets would help a clinician to distinguish .... ." as this guidance is expected to be followed by laboratories  other bottles within the set may be positive as well and it is unlikely that a doctor would stop empirical therapy because of one negative blood culture bottle result reported from the lis. the expected preliminary result would most likely be negative-to-date rather than the negative that is potentially reported due to this issue. cumitech also states "it can be concluded from available data that two to four blood cultures are necessary to optimize detection of bacteremia and fungemia." cumitech 1c  blood culture iv  states that prior to leaving the patient's bedside the following details are to be included on culture bottle label(s): two unique identifiers (e.g. name  birthdate  social security number  etc.); collector's name  employee number  and/or employee code; collection site (e.g. vein  arm  leg  etc.); the amount of blood collected  if different from the culture bottle requirements). if the bottle is called positive  the technologist will unload it to subculture and gram stain. proper bottle labeling by the user makes it likely that the negative result initially reported would be detected. additionally  if the bottle is true positive the physician is immediately notified and the result is updated in the database management system (i.e. observa?) or laboratory information system (lis). therefore  it is highly likely that the false initial report would be detected and the positive result will be reported for the correct patient. health hazard assessment (hha) by medical doctor indicated the issue is not expected to have a negative impact on patient health due to both product mitigations  as well as mitigations that occur in the context of the clinical environment. even though there is no necessary corrective action needed in the field  this event is being reported under 21 cfr 803  medical device reporting as a reportable malfunction. a corrective and preventive action (capa) investigation has been initiated to ensure this type of labeling issue does not recur.><biom?rieux conducted an internal investigation: the investigation examined the bact/alert manufacturing directions  including the quality control release testing documentation  and all results were within specification. quality assurance subsequently released the lots for distribution to the field. the customer lis is the root cause of this investigation. since all bottle ids are retained in memory indefinitely and bottle id numbers are finite  a duplication of bottle id will eventually occur. the current workflow of using a generic bottle barcode label on bottles recognized as duplicate should be continued. biom?rieux recommends a purge of bottle ids from the lis database with more than a predetermined number of days of being unloaded based on customer needs. as interim mitigation  (b)(4) cases of bact/alert sa product were shipped. these bottle ids were evaluated against the customer lis to ensure no previously provided bottle ids were repeated. the complaint was received from one customer at two different locations for alleged duplicate bottle ids. the root cause was determined to be limitation created by the customer lis setup. the bottles performed as intended  no irregularities were identified during the production process and the lot itself was not adversely impacted."

AN INTERNAL CAPA HAS BEEN INITIATED TO EVALUATE REPORTS OF ELEVATED WBC COUNTS.><(B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE SIGNALS IN THE RDF DO NOT INDICATE A CLEAR CAUSE FOR THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED PLATELET PRODUCT VOLUME AND THE ELEVATED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. BASED ON THE REPORTED PRODUCT VOLUME, THE DONOR WAS STILL WITHIN THE 15% TOTAL BLOOD VOLUME DONOR VOLUME LIMIT SPECIFIED IN THE MACHINE'S CONFIGURATIONS. FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE TBV WOULD BE 569ML; 458ML WAS REPORTED AS COLLECTED, THEREFORE, MORE THAN THE 15% TBV VOLUME LIMIT WAS NOT COLLECTED. THE SIGNALS IN THE RDF DO INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A SMALL DIVERSION OF FLUID FROM THE RETURN RESERVOIR TO THE PLATELET PRODUCT DURING EACH DRAW AND RETURN CYCLE, HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME DIVERTED WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO TRIGGER A LEVEL SENSOR ERROR ALERT. IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT A POSSIBLE MISLOADING OF THE CASSETTE, SPECIFICALLY THE LOADING OF THE PLATELET PUMP HEADER, COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A SMALL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCT VOLUME BEING PUMPED TO THE PRODUCT BAGS EACH DRAW AND RETURN CYCLE. THIS VOLUME COULD HAVE ACCUMULATED OVER EACH DRAW AND RETURN CYCLE AND RESULTED IN THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED PLATELET PRODUCT VOLUME. THERE IS NO CLEAR INDICATION IN THE RDF OF ANY POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. HOWEVER, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THE ELEVATED WBC CONTENT COULD BE A POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECT OF A MISLOADED PLATELET PUMP HEADER. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFO, IT ALSO CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THE VOLUME AND WBC ISSUES COULD BE CAUSED BY WEIGHING, CALCULATION, OR OTHER PROCESS ERROR.

THE RESULT: PERFECT BABY WAS BORN - THAT IS GOOD! (PH FROM THE UMBILICAL CORD WAS 7,31) (THE BABY WAS EXAMINED CAREFULLY LATER IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBLE HEART DISEASES.

COULD THERE BE ANY EFFECT (SORT OF INTERFERENCE) IF THE TOCO TRANSDUCER IS LAID BESIDE THE MOTHER - NOT REGISTRATING THE CONTRACTIONS AT THAT TIME?" THE EXAMINATION OF THE DIGITAL STAN DEVICE TRACING SUGGESTS THAT THE SKIN ELECTRODE WAS LOOSE (SEE BLUE FIELD IN FIGURE ABOVE) AND THEREFORE, NO CORRECT RECORDING OF FETAL HEART RATE OR ST INFO COULD BE PERFORMED BY THE STAN DEVICE.

IT CAN BE SEEN FROM DIGITAL DATA, THAT DURING THIS PERIOD, THE SYSTEM APPEARS TO HAVE PICKED UP SOME SORT OF PERIODIC SIGNAL INTERFERENCE IN THE SPIRAL-TO-SCALP LEAD, WITH AN AMPLITUDE FOUR TIMES STRONGER THAN THE BABY'S QRS AMPLITUDE, INTERFERENCE TO THE RIGHT, FETAL ECG QRS-COMPLEX TO THE LEFT. THIS TYPE OF RAW DATA SEGMENT ARE ONLY STORED ONCE EVERY FIVE MINUTES, AND THEREFORE, ONLY ONE OF THESE PEAKS ARE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FOUR-MINUTE INTERFERENCE. THIS MOST LIKELY CAUSED THE FHR DETECTION ALGORITHM TO STOP TRIGGING ON THE BABY QRS, AND STARTED TO PRESENT AN FHR TRACE BASED ON THIS STRONGER SIGNAL INSTEAD. (SIMILAR BEHAVIOUR WAS ACTUALLY SEEN FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS EARLIER IN THE RECORDING AS WELL, WHEN THE SKIN ELECTRODE ALSO BECAME LOOSE.) THE SOURCE FOR THIS INTERFERENCE HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY. AS THE DIGITAL DATA SHOWS VERY GOOD SIGNAL QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE APART FROM THE PERIODS OF HIGH ELECTRODE IMPEDANCE, THE DEVICE IS CONSIDERED TO WORK ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. BUT TO ENSURE THIS, FRONT-END ELECTRONICS (ELECTRODE CABLE AND INPUT AMPLIFIER) HAVE BEEN REQUESTED FOR EVAL, AS WELL AS COMPLEMENTARY INFO OF ELECTRODE BRANDS USED. WHEN SKIN OR SCALP ELECTRODE IS NOT PROPERLY ATTACHED THIS IS CLEARLY INDICATED BY THE DEVICE BY GIVING AN ALARM. INSTRUCTIONS TO CHECK SKIN AND SCALP ELECTRODES ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE USER MANUALS AND IT IS ALSO PART OF TROUBLESHOOTING OF SIGNAL QUALITY PROBLEMS IN TRAINING MATERIAL. NO FURTHER FIELD ACTIONS ARE JUSTIFIED.

6085003	0	(b)(6) center had a patient on the table for a dcs implant and had failed to obtain an implant for the surgery. (b)(6), the sales rep in that area, did not have any inventory on hand. (b)(6) contacted (b)(6) whom was able to provide an implant for the surgery. the item they provided was lot # 107903, part number 17111. this item was packaged in july of 2009 and expired in july of 2016. (b)(6) was contacted by biopro in early 2016 to send that inventory back, (b)(6) indicated that they had no inventory of that lot number and biopro was unable to retrieve it for repackaging. (b)(6) kept expired inventory, (b)(6) received the inventory, which was labeled, and never checked the expiration date on the label prior to implantation. this lot # did indeed expire in july of 2016; the job packet with the label is attached to the complaint. upon review of the real time aging study for the tyvek pouches it was noted that although biopro has established the shelf life for the pouches at 7 years, many of the pieces that were tested to determine this were actually aged to 7 years and 7 months. the complete real time aging study is located in regulatory affairs. the aging study was conducted in october of 2003 and the samples tested were packed from march, 1996 through january, 1998. the expiration date is clearly marked on the dcs label, but it is small. the current version of the dcs label is larger and the expiration date is more pronounced.><(b)(6) center did not verify the expiration date of the implant in question prior to implanting it. biopro attempted to retrieve this specific item prior to expiration and was told that (b)(6) did not have it. (b)(6) did indeed have it and provided it to (b)(6) center and it was implanted after the date of expiration. the expiration date was clearly visible on the label. the following letter was prepared and provided to (b)(6): re: digital compression screw, item number 17111, lot # 107903, expiration date 07-2016. at the time of implantation in (b)(6) 2016, the label on this component indicated that the part was beyond its expiration date. this expiration date is in relation to the sterile packaging, not the actual component. the shelf life for product utilizing tyvek pouches like the dcs is packaged in has been established by biopro to be 7 years from date of packaging. this time was established in 2003 as a result of a real time aging test conducted by an outside contractor. the pieces tested were at that time up to 7 years and 7 months post packaging, which exceeds the 7 year and 3 month age of the piece in question. test results of all components of the real time aging test were reviewed and all pieces tested met or exceeded the acceptance criteria to be considered sterile. based on the testing conducted and the age of the piece implanted i am certain that the device in question maintained its sterility and there is no risk to the patient. device is implanted and not available.

PARTIAL LOSS OF BONE MARROW (RTD = 53%). THIS REPORT IS BEING MADE DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF THE STEM CELLS CAUSED BY A PRODUCT PROBLEM DISCOVERED AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS REPORT ON 06/03/2010. (B)(4). THE 2991 ROUND BAG AND CERAMIC SEAL WERE RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION. UPON RECEIPT CARIDIANBCT INVESTIGATORS CONFIRMED THAT THE CERAMIC SEAL DID NOT FREELY ROTATE. BLOOD RESIDUE WAS NOTED ABOVE THE CERAMIC SEAL AND MINIMAL RESIDUE IN THE ROUND BAG. THE TUBE BELOW THE CERAMIC SEAL WAS SEVERELY TWISTED AND HAD DETACHED FROM THE SEAL. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE FAILURE APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO A VENDOR MANUFACTURING DEFECT. INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AT THE CERAMIC SUPPLIER, THE CORRECT PROCEDURE WAS NOT FOLLOWED, RESULTING IN ORGANIC SALTS REMAINING ON THE SMOOTH MATING SURFACE OF THE CERAMIC SEAL, WHICH THEN ACTS AS A HOLDING AGENT. THE INTERFERENCE OF THE HOLDING AGENT CAUSED THE SEAL TO NOT PERFORM AS INTENDED INCLUDING TWISTING THE POSSIBLE BREAKAGE DURING PROCESSING RESULTING IN THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF PRODUCT. CORRECTIVE/PREVENTIVE ACTION: THE SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING SUPERVISORS WERE NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE AND RETRAINING WAS REQUESTED. AN ADDITIONAL INSPECTION STATION HAS ALSO BEEN ADDED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO ENSURE THE ROTATING SEAL IS NOT SEIZED AND FUNCTIONS PROPERLY PRIOR TO PACKAGING. IN AUGUST 2009, AN ADDITIONAL WASH CYCLE WAS INCORPORATED AT THE CERAMIC SUPPLIER TO PRODUCE CLEANER PARTS. RISK OF BONE MARROW LOSS MAY BE MITIGATED BY SPLITTING THE BONE MARROW INTO TWO BATCHES THAT ARE KEPT SEPARATE UNTIL ALL PROCESSING IS COMPLETE. (B)(4). WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

2012257	0	THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT DESCRIPTION WAS PROVIDED TO CARIDIANBCT: THE CUSTOMER HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHY THEY HAD TO INCREASE THE RUN TIME BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE REPLACEMENT FLUID HAD BEEN GIVEN. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE PT WAS FINE AND DID NOT REQUIRE MEDICAL INTERVENTION. (B)(4). THE CUSTOMER REPORTED TWO ISSUES THAT THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN. THE FIRST ISSUE WAS THAT THEY HAD 8 BOTTLES OF 500 ML ALBUMIN FOR REPLACEMENT, BUT HAD TO INCREASE THE RUN TIME, BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE ALBUMIN WAS GIVEN WHEN THEY REACHED 4000 ML. THE FINAL REPLACEMENT VOLUME DISPLAYED WAS 5061 ML. THE SECOND ISSUE WAS THAT THE PRIME SALINE BAG WAS EMPTY WHEN THEY WANTED TO PERFORM RINSEBACK. THE CUSTOMER WANTED TO KNOW IF THE MACHINE COULD HAVE DRAWN THE SALINE FROM THE PRIME BAG, WHICH WOULD THEN MAKE THE REPLACEMENT VOLUME HIGHER THAN INTENDED. THE CUSTOMER DID NOT NOTICE ANY OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE TUBING SET. PER THE RUN SHEET, THE LAST BOTTLE OF ALBUMIN TOOK THE LONGEST. THEY DID NOT WEIGH THE PLASMA WASTE BAG, BUT THE CUSTOMER SAID IT WAS VERY FULL AND SEEMED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE DISPLAYED REMOVE VOLUME. BASED ON THE VOLUMES PROVIDED ON THE RUN SHEET AND AN AVAILABLE REPLACEMENT VOLUME OF 4000 ML, THERE WAS A FLUID DEFICIT OF 808 ML FOR THIS PT. THE PT DID NOT HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS FROM THIS PROCEDURE. THE CUSTOMER'S BIOMED CHECKED OUT THE SPECTRA MACHINE AND DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THE SAME MACHINE WAS USED FOR THREE MORE TREATMENTS ON THE SAME PT WITHOUT INCIDENT. ROOT CAUSE: THIS DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. BASED ON THE CUSTOMER'S RUN SHEET AND THE FACT THAT THE FIRST SEVEN BOTTLES EMPTIED NORMALLY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FLOW PATH BECAME PARTIALLY OCCLUDED AND CAUSED THE ALBUMIN TO EMPTY MORE SLOWLY. IT IS UNCONFIRMED WHETHER A BLOCKAGE WAS PRODUCED BY A MFG DEFECT OF THE COBE SPECTRA DISPOSABLE OR BY THE WAY THE DISPOSABLE WAS HANDLED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE.

2645718	1	CRITICALLY ILL PT WITH MULTI-ORGAN DYSFUNCTION COMPLICATED BY URINARY TRACT INFECTION AND POSSIBLE OSTEOMYELITIS, WHO IS IN NEED OF MAJOR SURGERY OF THE HEART. THE EMR CONTAINS INNUMERABLE ORDERS, TREATMENTS, MEDICATIONS, AND MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION RECORDS THAT ARE OBFUSCATED WITH MEANINGFULLY IMMATERIAL VERBIAGE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DEVICE IS POORLY USABLE AND THE COURSE OF THE PT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK AND COMPREHEND. WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONSULTANT STOPPED ANTIBIOTICS, WHICH WAS REINFORCED WITH PROGRESS NOTES. ANOTHER CONSULTANT'S PARAPROFESSIONAL MISSED OR IGNORED THAT THE ANTIBIOTICS WERE DISCONTINUED AND ORDERED THEM, PUTTING THE PT AT RISK BY JEOPARDIZING SCHEDULED BONE BIOPSY CULTURES, WHICH, IN TURN, WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE DECISION TO OPERATE AND THE TIMING OF THE SURGERY. THE CASE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DYSFUNCTIONAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT WORK FLOWS THAT ARE PART AND PARCEL OF CPOE AND EHR DEVICES WHEN USED FOR COMPLEX CASES. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE COURSE OF EVENTS AND RECONCILE ORDERS WITH CONSULTANT'S PROGRESS NOTES BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A USER FRIENDLY CONTEMPORANEOUS LISTING OF THE ORDERS AS THEY WERE ENTERED AND BY WHOM; AND THE DISCONTINUATION, OF ORDERS, DETAILS NOT LIST THE DOCTOR WHO ENTERED THAT; AND THE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION RECORDS ARE PARTICULARLY UNUSABLE DUE TO THE MEANINGFULLY USELESS EXPANSIVE GRID LAYOUT AND ABSENCE OF A SEARCH FUNCTION.

2465886	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PT INFO IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS LOT NUMBER. THERE WERE NO ISSUES NOTED THAT WERE RELATED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT THAT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCED. ROOT CAUSE: THE ANALYSIS OF THE RDF DID NOT FIND A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE OF THE ELEVATED RWBC CONTENT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. SIGNALS IN THE RDF INDICATE IT IS POSSIBLE, THOUGH NOT CONCLUSIVE, THAT THE PLASMA LINE MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OCCLUDED NEAR THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. IF THE PLASMA LINE DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE PROPERLY TO THE PLATELET PUMP, IT COULD CAUSE THE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTEM EXPECTS, POSSIBLY ALLOWING SOME WBCS TO ESCAPE ORIENTATION OF THE HEX IN THE HEX HOLDER MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THIS. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT A SAMPLING, CALCULATION, OR OTHER PROCESS ERROR MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. CORRECTIVE ACTION: ALGORITHMS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SOFTWARE FOR THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. THESE ALGORITHMS WILL RECOGNIZE A POTENTIAL ELEVATED WBC COUNT DUE TO THE FAILURE MODE WITNESSED DURING THIS INVESTIGATION. THE SOFTWARE WILL FLAG THE PROCEDURE TO MEASURE OR "VERIFY WBC IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT". THE NEW ALGORITHMS WILL BE ADDED TO THE NEXT TRIM EQUIPMENT SOFTWARE UPGRADE, VERSION 6.0.3, WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING VALIDATED. ADDITIONALLY, AN INTERNAL CAPA HAS BEEN INITIATED TO EVALUATE REPORTS OF ELEVATED WBCS.

temperature management system is intended for monitoring and controlling patient temperature. warnings and cautions - warnings: do not use the arctic sun? temperature management system in the presence of flammable agents because an explosion and/or fire may result. do not use high frequency surgical instruments or endocardial catheters while the arctic sun? temperature management system is in use. there is a risk of electrical shock and hazardous moving parts. there are no user serviceable parts inside. do not remove covers. refer servicing to qualified personnel. power cord has a hospital grade plug. grounding reliability can only be achieved when connected to an equivalent receptacle marked ?hospital use? or ?hospital grade?. when using the arctic sun? temperature management system  note that all other thermal conductive systems  such as water blankets and water gels  in use while warming or cooling with the arctic sun? temperature management system may actually alter or interfere with patient temperature control. do not place arcticgel? pads over transdermal medication patches as warming can increase drug delivery  resulting in possible harm to the patient. cautions: this product is to be used by or under the supervision of trained  qualified medical personnel. federal law (usa) restricts this device to sale  by or on the order of a physician. use only distilled or sterile water. the use of other fluids will damage the arctic sun? temperature management system. when moving the arctic sun? temperature management system always use the handle to lift the controller over an obstacle to avoid over balancing. the patient bed surface should be located between 30 and 60 inches (75 cm and 150 cm) above the floor to ensure proper flow and minimize risk of leaks. the clinician is responsible to determine the appropriateness of custom parameters. when the system is powered off  all changes to parameters will revert to the default unless the new settings have been saved as new defaults in the advanced setup screen. for small patients (=(b)(6) kg) it is recommended to use the following settings: water temperature high limit =40??c (104??f); water temperature low limit =10??c (64.4 ??f); control strategy =2. the operator must continuously monitor patient temperature when using manual control and adjust the temperature of the water flowing through the pads accordingly. patient temperature will not be controlled by the arctic sun? temperature management system in manual control. due to the systems high efficiency  manual control is not recommended for long duration use. the operator is advised to use the automatic therapy modes (e.g. control patient  cool patient  rewarm patient) for automatic patient temperature monitoring and control. the arctic sun? temperature management system will monitor and control patient core temperature based on the temperature probe attached to the system. the clinician is responsible for correctly placing the temperature probe and verifying the accuracy and placement of the patient probe at the start of the procedure. medivance recommends measuring patient temperature from a second site to verify patient temperature. medivance recommends the use of a second patient temperature probe connected to the arctic sun? temperature management system temperature 2 input as it provides continuous monitoring and safety alarm features. alternatively  patient temperature may be verified periodically with independent instrumentation. the displayed temperature graph is for general information purposes only and is not intended to replace standard medical record documentation for use in therapy decisions. patient temperature will not be controlled and alarms are not enabled in stop mode. patient temperature may increase or decrease with the arctic sun? temperature management system in stop mode. carefully observe the system for air leaks before and during use. if the pads fail to prime or a significant continuous air leak is observed in the pad return line  check connections. if needed  replace the leaking pad. leakage may result in lower flow rates and potentially decrease the performance of the system. the arctic sun? temperature management system is for use only with the arcticgel? pads. the arcticgel? pads are only for use with the arctic sun? temperature management systems. the arcticgel? pads are non-sterile for single patient use. do not reprocess or sterilize. if used in a sterile environment  pads should be placed according to the physician request  either prior to the sterile preparation or sterile draping. arcticgel? pads should not be placed on a sterile field. use pads immediately after opening. do not store pads once the kit has been opened. do not place arcticgel? pads on skin that has signs of ulceration  burns  hives  or rash. while there are no known allergies to hydrogel materials  caution should be exercised with any patient who has a history of skin allergies or sensitivities. do not allow circulating water to contaminate the sterile field when patient lines are disconnected. the water content of the hydrogel affects the pad adhesion to the skin and conductivity  and therefore  the efficiency of controlling patient temperature. periodically check that pads remain moist and adherent. replace pads when the hydrogel no longer uniformly adheres to the skin. replacing pads at least every 5 days is recommended. do not puncture the arcticgel? pads with sharp objects. punctures will result in air entering the fluid pathway and may reduce performance. if accessible  examine the patient skin under the arcticgel? pads often  especially those at higher risk of skin injury. skin injury may occur as a cumulative result of pressure  time and temperature. do not place bean bag or other firm positioning devices under the arcticgel? pads. do not place positioning devices under the pad manifolds or patient lines. the rate of temperature change and potentially the final achievable patient temperature is affected by many factors. treatment application  monitoring and results are the responsibility of the attending physician. if the patient does not reach target temperature in a reasonable time or the patient is not able to be maintained at the target temperature  the skin may be exposed to low or high water temperatures for an extended period of time which may increase the risk for skin injury. ensure that pad sizing / coverage and custom parameter settings are correct for the patient and treatment goals  water flow is greater than or equal to 2.3 liters per minute and the patient temperature probe is in the correct place. for patient cooling  ensure environmental factors such as excessively hot rooms  heat lamps  and heated nebulizers are eliminated and patient shivering is controlled. otherwise  consider increasing minimum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment. for patient warming  consider decreasing maximum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment. due to underlying medical or physiological conditions  some patients are more susceptible to skin damage from pressure and heat or cold. patients at risk include those with poor tissue perfusion or poor skin integrity due to diabetes  peripheral vascular disease  poor nutritional status  steroid use or high dose vasopressor therapy. if warranted  use pressure relieving or pressure reducing devices under the patient to protect from skin injury. do not allow urine  antibacterial solutions or other agents to pool underneath the arcticgel? pads. urine and antibacterial agents can absorb into the pad hydrogel and cause chemical injury and loss of pad adhesion. replace pads immediately if these fluids come into contact with the hydrogel. do not place arcticgel? pads over an electrosurgical grounding pad. the combination of heat sources may result in skin burns. if needed  place defibrillation pads between the arcticgel? pads and the patient?s skin. carefully remove arcticgel? pads from the patient?s skin at the completion of use. discard used arcticgel? pads in accordance with hospital procedures for medical waste. the usb data port is to be used only with a stand alone usb flash drive. do not connect to another mains powered device during patient treatment. users should not use cleaning or decontamination methods different from those recommended by the manufacturer without first checking with the manufacturer that the proposed methods will not damage the equipment. do not use bleach (sodium hypochlorite) as it may damage the system. medivance will not be responsible for patient safety or equipment performance if the procedures to operate  maintain  modify or service the medivance arctic sun? temperature management system are other than those specified by medivance. anyone performing the procedures must be appropriately trained and qualified."

1022528	1	GE WAS REQUESTED TO VERIFY THAT ALARMS WERE WORKING AT THE CCU CIC CENTRAL STATION. AFTER BRIEF INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SPEAKERS HAD BEEN UNPLUGGED FROM THE CIC, AND THEREFORE NO AUDIBLE ALARMS WERE ABLE TO BE HEARD. A PT DEATH WAS REPORTED. THE SPEAKERS WERE RECONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM AND THE NURSE MGR WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FINDINGS. >< THE LOG FILES FROM CIC AT THE TIME OF EVENT OCCURENCE WERE NOT AVAILABLE, SO THE ALARM VOLUME SETTING CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FACILITY WAS USING PREMIERE MULTIMEDIA SPEAKER SYSTEM MODEL PDM/5. IF THE EXTERNAL SPEAKERS ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE CIC, AN INTERNAL SPEAKER IS ACTIVATED AS A BACKUP AND A WARNING MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED INDICATING THAT THE EXTERNAL SPEAKERS ARE UNPLUGGED. THE FACILITY DID REPORT THAT WHEN THE EXTERNAL SPEAKERS WERE UNPLUGGED, THE ERROR MESSAGE INDICATING SPEAKERS ARE UNPLUGGED APPEARED, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT INTERNAL SPEAKERS WERE ACTIVE. GE INVESTIGATION TEAM SUSPECTS THAT THE VOLUME LEVEL OF INTERNAL SPEAKERS WAS SET TOO LOW FOR THE USER TO HEAR. THE CIC SERVICE MANUAL CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING NOTED: 'EXTERNAL SPEAKERS ARE CONNECTED DURING NORMAL OPERATION. AN ALERT MESSAGE DISPLAYS WHEN NO EXTERNAL SPEAKER CONNECTION IS PRESENT. THIS IS TRUE EVENT IF THE CIC PRO CENTER IS USED AS A MIRRORED CIC PRO CENTER AND ITS AUDIBLE ALARM VOLUME IS SET TO OFF'.
938366	0	(b)(4). concomitant medical products: cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list # 8h49-02. in the previously submitted medwatch -01 follow up, the customer complaint was inadvertently not associated with remedial action correction 2919069-8/6/07-004-c in error. the customer used the suspect device at the customer facility. this follow up mdr for 2919069-8/6/07-004-c is submitted late. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number 8h49-02, was manufactured on (b)(4) 2007 and was identified by (b)(4) to have been manufactured with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the tip of the syringe plunger. the affected syringes with a package date of (b)(4) 2007 through (b)(4) 2007, caused the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer to generate an error message upon installation of the syringe or shortly thereafter. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe was distributed for the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer only and did not impact other cell-dyn analyzers. the issue was resolved when a new cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list 8h49-04, was manufactured by (b)(4) and released for distribution on (b)(4) 2009. >< the customer contacted abbott regarding cell-dyn sapphire syringe 'failed to home' error messages observed on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer. the customer stated the error occurred seven times in 24 hours, and the syringe was cleaned after the initial error. the customer noted the syringe plunger was very stiff. the abbott customer technical advocate (cta) instructed the customer to install new syringe and the customer was to monitor the syringe over the weekend and contact the cta if further assistance was needed. it is unknown if there was impact to patient management. >< the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe is used on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer, an automated hematology analyzer. the vendor for the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number 08h49-02 provided abbott laboratories with an improved version of the syringe, which was released for use on 5/8/2007. the vendor sent a letter to abbott stating the hemoglobin syringes with a specific manufacturing code, were assembled with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the plunger tip. the absence of sufficient lubricant causes premature failure of the syringe, which generated 'syringe failed to home' error messages upon installation on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer or shortly thereafter. in response to the vendor's letter, abbott internal nonconformance was addressed via stock sweeps to segregate non-conforming product in inventory. a world wide quality hold was issued 22 june 2007 to remove suspect product from the distribution system and a customer letter was generated to users of the cell-dyn sapphire analyzers. the defective syringes were identified in the customer letter as those packaged and shipped between 08 may 2007 and 25 june 2007. a review of abbott's complaint analysis system from january 2007 to present did not indicate an adverse trend for hemoglobin syringes. as the affected syringes did not meet the vendor's internal lubricant requirements, the vendor provided the following corrective actions: vendor employee retraining for syringe lubricant application was completed on 6/19/07. a 100% part inspection of the syringe will be performed and inspection results will be attached to the syringe shipment. abbott syringe specifications were defined for use by the vendor. certification documents are attached on every shipment of syringes. this is the final report.

2126506	0	WE ARE INFORMED BY FDA WITH AN ADVERSE EVENT VIA EMAIL. ACCORDING TO THE EMAIL FROM (B)(6) OF FDA RECEIVED ON (B)(6) 2011, FDA RECEIVED A VOLUNTARY REPORT INVOLVING A DEATH OF A PERSON USING THE ADVOCATE DUO METER. BECAUSE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY REPORT, FDA CANNOT PROVIDE US WITH THE PT'S NAME OR PERSONAL INFORMATION DUE TO FDA'S CONFIDENTIALITY RULES. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT FDA RECEIVED, THE INDIVIDUAL WAS ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL AFTER INCURRING A FALL ON OR ABOUT (B)(6) 2009. THE METER GLUCOSE RESULTS DID NOT MATCH THE HOSPITAL GLUCOSE RESULTS FROM THEIR LABORATORY INSTRUMENT. THE DUO READINGS WERE 240 MG/DL AND THE HOSPITAL OBTAINED 439 MG/DL. ON REPEAT ANALYSIS, THE DUO READ 539 MG/DL AND THE HOSPITAL OBTAINED 440 MG/DL. FDA DO NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE LOT NUMBER OF TEST STRIPS THE PERSON WAS USING, NOR THE MODEL NUMBER OF THE DEVICE. THE PT DIED IN (B)(6) 2010. WE HAVE STARTED AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT THIS INCIDENT RIGHT AWAY WHEN WE WERE NOTIFIED BY FDA. DUE TO LACK OF INFORMATION OF STRIP LOT NUMBER AND METER SERIAL NUMBER, WE WERE UNABLE TO KNOW WHICH EXACT LOT OF METER OR STRIPS WERE USED BY PT. THEREFORE, WE PULLED OUT THE RECORD OF ADVOCATE DUO METERS AND STRIPS SHIPPED TO THE US DURING 2009 (B)(6) AND BACKTRACED TO 88 LOTS OF STRIPS AND 4 LOTS OF METERS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF INCIDENT ON (B)(6) 2009. TO INVESTIGATE THE ROOT CAUSE AND TO VERIFY IF THIS INCIDENT IS RELATED TO THE DEVICE BASED ON THE LIMITED INFORMATION WE HAD, WE DECIDED TO SINGLE OUT 5 LARGEST AMOUNTS OF STRIP LOTS FROM 88 LOTS SHIPPED TO US FOR FURTHER TESTING. WE PERFORMED PERFORMANCE TESTS INCLUDING CONTROL SOLUTION AND WHOLE BLOOD TESTS WITH THE RESERVE TEST STRIPS FROM THE 4 SAME LOTS USING RESERVE METER SAMPLE OF THE SAME MODEL. BASED ON RESULTS OF THE TESTS, ALL CONTROL SOLUTION AND WHOLE BLOOD TEST RESULTS OF ADVOCATE DUO USING THE 5 STRIP LOTS WERE WITHIN THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THOSE 5 STRIPS LOTS OF ADVOCATE DUO WORK NORMAL. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE IS A GAP OF TIME FOR AROUND THREE MONTHS BETWEEN DATES OF THE PT ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL AND THE PT'S DEATH. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO PT DURING WHICH TIME. WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE CAUSE OF DEATH IS AND NO EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THE DEATH IS RELATED TO ADVOCATE DUO. WITHOUT DETAILS OF THE DEVICE USED BY PT AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE PT, WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE IF ADVOCATE DUO IS RELATED TO OR CAUSE THE DEATH OF PT.

THE BUG IS LOCATED IN THE PART OF THE SOFTWARE THAT HANDLES VISUALIZATION OF NERVE FIBER TRACTS THAT ARE EXTRACTED FROM A DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING MR SERIES. THE DETECTED ISSUE CAN CAUSE EXPORT AND VISUALIZATION OF FIBERS WITH WRONG POSITIONING IN RELATION THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL DATASET. THIS CAN OCCUR WHEN ALL THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: USING TWO DIFFERENT STRUCTURAL DATASETS THAT HAVE IDENTICAL RESOLUTION AND NUMBER OF SLICES; THE STRUCTURAL DATASETS ARE NOT ORIGINALLY ALIGNED BUT ARE THEN ALIGNED THROUGH CO-REGISTRATION IN NORDICBRAINEX. IT OCCURS WHEN CHANGING UNDERLAY IN THE 3D VIEWER FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THESE STRUCTURAL DATASETS AFTER PERFORMING THE FIBER TRACKING, AND THEN CREATING AND EXPORTING/VISUALIZING FIBER GROUPS. THE ISSUE IS CAUSED BY THE FIBERS NOT BEING REALIGNED TO THE CO-REGISTERED POSITION OF THE SECOND DATASET WHEN CHANGING THE UNDERLAY, BUT WHEN FIBERS ARE EXPORTED OR VISUALIZED IN THE MPR THE CO-REGISTRATION INFORMATION IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, CAUSING WRONG POSITIONING OF THE FIBERS WHEN LATER VISUALIZED ON A STRUCTURAL DATASET. THE MISALIGNMENT OF THE FIBERS WILL THEN BE IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE ALIGNMENT PERFORMED BY THE NORDICBRAINEX COREGISTRATION BETWEEN THE TWO STRUCTURAL DATASETS. TO AVOID THIS ISSUE ONE SHOULD NOT CHANGE UNDERLAY IN THE 3D VIEWER WHEN WORKING WITH DTI AND/OR FIBER GROUPS, UNLESS ONE IS ABSOLUTELY SURE THE DATASETS DIFFER IN RESOLUTION AND/OR NUMBER OF SLICES. THIS BUG IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS IF THE MISALIGNMENT IS NOT SEEN BY THE USER. IN MOST CASES IT WILL PROBABLY BE DISCOVERED BY THE USER BECAUSE THE FIBERS DON'T MATCH THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES, BUT IF THE MISALIGNMENT IS NOT SO LARGE AND/OR THE FIBER GROUP IS LOCATED IN A PART OF THE BRAIN WHERE IT IS NOT SO EASY TO COMPARE WITH ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES, THE MISALIGNMENT IS MAYBE NOT DISCOVERED. THIS COULD THEREFORE, BE HARMFUL TO THE PATIENT IF THE INFORMATION IS USED IN FOR EXAMPLE NEUROSURGERY PLANNING.

2068341	1	DURING INVESTIGATION OF THE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH MDR 2183553-2011-00005, IT WAS DISCOVERED INTERNALLY THAT THE HFO5 PRODUCT IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE REPORTED ISSUE. THERE WAS NO PT INVOLVEMENT FOR THE INTERNALLY DISCOVERED ISSUE. SCREEN SAVED IMAGES FROM THE MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MR) SYSTEM WILL ATTACH TO THE INCORRECT PT ON THE PICTURE ARCHIVE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM (PACS). WHEN THE USERS SEND A SCREEN SAVE IMAGE FROM THE MR SYSTEM TO THE PACS, THE SCREEN SAVE IS THEN ATTACHED TO THE CORRECT EXAM ON THE MR SYSTEM; HOWEVER, ON THE PACS, THE SCREEN SAVE MAY ATTACH TO A DIFFERENT PT/EXAM. INITIAL EVALUATION INDICATES THAT THE ISSUE IS CAUSED WHEN THE MR SYSTEM REPLICATES THE SERIES INSTANCE UID (0X0020, 0X000E) BETWEEN THE TWO SCREEN SAVE IMAGES. HOWEVER, THE TWO SCREEN SAVE IMAGES BOTH ARE USING THE SAME SERIES INSTANCE UID (0020, 000E). GE HEALTHCARE'S INVESTIGATION INTO THE REPORTED OCCURRENCE IS STILL ONGOING.

1591096	1	THE USER REPORTED THAT THEY HAD A PT CODE AND THE DEVICE'S NIBP PARAMETER DID NOT WORK. >< THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER'S FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSE) VISITED THE CUSTOMER SITE TO EVALUATE THE DEVICE. THE FSE WAS ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE REPORTED PROBLEM AND REPLACED THE DEVICE'S RADIO AS A RESULT OF HIS EVAL. ALTHOUGH THE USER REPORTED A PROBLEM WITH THE NIBP PARAMETER, THE ACTUAL PROBLEM WAS WITH THE DEVICE'S RADIO. THE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVICE'S RADIO CAUSED THE REQUESTED NIBP READING TO NOT BE TRANSMITTED FROM THE DISPLAY MONITOR (WHERE IT IS INITIATED) TO THE BASE MONITOR (WHICH ACTUALLY TAKES THE NIBP READING). FOLLOWING REPLACEMENT OF THE RADIO, THE DEVICE WAS FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PER INTERNAL TEST PROCEDURES AND RETURNED TO SERVICE BY THE USER. WE ARE CONSIDERING THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR EMERGENT CARE BECAUSE THE PT WAS REPORTED AS HAVING CODED. THEREFORE, THIS IS CONSIDERED AS A SERIOUS INJURY. THE AVAILABLE INFO GIVES NO INDICATION THAT THE INABILITY OF THE USERS TO OPERATE THE NIBP FUNCTION WAS A FACTOR IN THE CODE. IF THIS MALFUNCTION WERE TO RECUR, IT WOULD NOT LEAD TO A SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH BECAUSE THIS MALFUNCTION WOULD BE OBVIOUS TO THE USER. IF THE MALFUNCTION WERE TO RECUR, THE USER IS LIKELY TO UTILIZE A BACK-UP MONITOR TO PROCEED WITH THE CASE. IF A BACK-UP MONITOR WAS UNAVAILABLE AND LACK OF A BACK-UP MONITOR WAS TO PRECLUDE THE USE OF THE SCANNING DEVICE IN DIAGNOSIS, ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSTIC METHODS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS WARRANTED FOR THE PT.

THE PT'S MOTHER CAME OUT AND ASKED A NURSE AND STUDENT NURSE TO COME IN THE ROOM. THE PT WAS VERY PALE AND BLUE AROUND THE MOUTH. THE CUSTOMER ALSO STATED, THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND EPISODE THAT DAY, WHEN THE PT WAS APNEIC. THE FIRST EPISODE WAS APPROX 20:20 AND WAS NOT WITNESSED BY ANY HOSPITAL STAFF. AFTER THE SECOND EPISODE, THE PT WAS TRANSFERRED TO PICU. PHILIPS IS CONSIDERING THAT EMERGENT CARE IS EXPECTED FOR THIS PT CONDITION AND THE CLINICIANS HAD NOT RESPONDED EFFECTIVELY TO THE CHANGE IN THE PT CONDITION, SO WE WILL CONSIDER THIS AS A SERIOUS INJURY, WHERE MONITORING WAS A FACTOR. A PHILIPS FIELD SVC ENGINEER (FSE), WENT ONSITE POST-INCIDENT AND TESTED THE INVOLVED DEVICE AND COLLECT DATA LOGS. THE CUSTOMER'S BIOMED TOLD THE FSE THAT HE TESTED THE MONITOR AND FOUND NO PROBLEM, THE MONITOR TESTED TO SPECIFICATIONS. THE LOG FILES WERE REVIEWED BY A PHILIPS CLINICAL SPECIALIST, WHO DETERMINED THAT THE MP30 MONITOR ALARMED FOR BOTH SPO2 DESATURATION INSTANCES. THE ALARM LOG SHOWS THAT IN 2008, AT 20:14:53 THERE WAS A RED DESAT ALARM REPORTED FOR THIS PT WITH A DESAT LEVEL OF 41, WHICH WAS SILENCED AT THE CENTRAL STATION AT 20:15:08, 55 SECONDS AFTER THE ALARM SOUNDED. THE SECOND REPORTED INCIDENT SHOWS ON THE SAME DAY, AT 23:22:32 THERE WAS A RED DESAT ALARM REPORTED FOR THIS PT WITH A DESAT LEVEL OF 21, FULLY CONSISTENT WITH IT BEING SILENCED AT THE BEDSIDE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE CUSTOMER'S CONFIGURATION FILE WAS DONE BY PHILIPS LEARNING PRODUCTS CLINICIAN, WHO DETERMINED THAT THE BEDSIDE ALARM IN THE CUSTOMER'S CONFIGURATION IS SET TO VOLUME 5 (OUT OF A POSSIBLE RANGE OF 01-10) WITH THE LOW VOLUME LIMIT AT 4.

HOWEVER, WHEN THE PARENT CHECKED ON THE PATIENT AT 7:20AM, THE PATIENT WAS REPORTEDLY IN CARDIAC ARREST AND THE DEVICE WAS NOT ALARMING. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL AND PASSED AWAY LATER THAT NIGHT. PER PHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE HOSPITAL¿S SENIOR PROFESSIONAL CARE MANAGER, THE HOSPITAL DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE DEVICE MALFUNCTIONED, BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE WAS A WAY TO TELL IF THE DEVICE WAS TURNED OFF OR IF IT SHUT DOWN ITSELF. THIS QUESTION WAS BASED ON AN INITIAL REVIEW OF A DOWNLOAD FROM THE DEVICE THAT INDICTED THAT THE DEVICE WAS NOT TURNED ON FROM 12:00AM TO 7:20AM ON (B)(6) 2015. THE HOSPITAL AND THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER REVIEWED THE DOWNLOAD AND IT SHOWED A LOOSE LEAD ALARM AT 12:00AM. FOLLOWING THE LOOSE LEAD ALARM, THE DOWNLOAD SHOWED THAT THE DEVICE WAS MANUALLY SHUT OFF BY THE USER AND WAS NOT TURNED BACK ON. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE DOWNLOAD INFORMATION, THE PARENT¿S CLAIM THAT THE DEVICE ALARMED AT 5:00AM CANNOT BE CONFIRMED. FURTHER REVIEW OF THE DEVICE DOWNLOAD SHOWED THAT UP UNTIL 12:00AM ON (B)(4) 2015, EVERY TIME THE DEVICE ALARMED, THE DEVICE WAS MANUALLY TURNED OFF AND TURNED BACK ON. THE ¿IF AN ALARM SOUNDS¿ SECTION CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING: ¿IF AN ALARM SOUNDS WHILE YOU ARE MONITORING YOUR BABY, CHECK YOUR BABY FIRST. THEN FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO RESPOND TO LIGHTS AND ALARMS. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BABY¿S SKIN COLOR. IS IT NORMAL? ALWAYS CHECK TO SEE IF YOUR BABY IS BREATHING. IF YOUR BABY IS NOT BREATHING, FOLLOW THE RESPOND LIKE THIS INSTRUCTION.¿ THE PARENTS¿ GUIDE THEN PROVIDES A TABLE THAT EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS ALARM LIGHTS, WHAT KIND OF ALARM IT IS (INTERMITTENT OR CONTINUOUS), A DESCRIPTION OF THE PATIENT¿S CONDITION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO THE ALARM. UNDER THE LOOSE LEADS ALARM, THE CUSTOMER IS PROVIDED WITH TROUBLESHOOTING LIKE CHECKING CONNECTIONS AND THEN RESETTING THE DEVICE. THERE IS ALSO A NOTE THAT STATES THAT ¿PATIENT ALARMS CANNOT BE SILENCED WITH THE RESET BUTTON. THE ALARM WILL STOP ONLY WHEN THE PATIENT SIGNALS ARE WITHIN THE ALARM LIMITS.¿ PHILIPS HEALTHCARE HAS RECEIVED THE DEVICE BACK FOR EVALUATION AND NO OBSERVATIONS SUBSTANTIATING A MALFUNCTION OR OTHER OPERATION OUTSIDE OF DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS WERE MADE DURING THE EVALUATION. THE DEVICE WAS FOUND TO OPERATE AND ALARM WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS TO NOTIFY A CAREGIVER OF A POTENTIAL EVENT. A 12 MONTH COMPLAINT REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THIS IS THE ONLY COMPLAINT FOR THIS ISSUE. PHILIPS HEALTHCARE HAS DETERMINED THAT THE COMPLAINT ISSUE ALLEGED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT OBSERVED DURING THE MANUFACTURER¿S EVALUATION OF THE PRODUCT. THE INVESTIGATION ALSO FOUND THAT THE DEVICE WAS SHUT OFF BY THE USER IN RESPONSE TO AN ALARM CONDITION AND NOT TURNED BACK ON AFTERWARDS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT USE OF THE DEVICE DOES NOT PRESENT AN INCREASED RISK TO THE END USER OR PATIENT AND THAT NO CORRECTIVE ACTION OR ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION ACTIVITY IS NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.

2757033	0	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH BACK GROUND PICTURE IMAGES ON THE TANGO OPTIMO. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT SHE WAS RUNNING MULTIPLE TYPE AND SCREEN SAMPLES AND ALL OF THE RESULTS WERE FINE EXCEPT THE LAST THREE PATIENTS. THE CUSTOMER STATES THE BACKGROUND HAS TURNED WHITE AND IS NOT A BLUE GREEN COLOR AS NORMAL. THESE THREE PATIENT SAMPLES ALSO HAD BUBBLES IN THE IMAGES. THE LAST THREE PATIENTS OF AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF REQUESTED PATIENTS (ASSAY ABSD3) HAVE BEEN PROCESSED WITHOUT COOMBS REAGENT BEING ADDED. THIS NUMBER EQUALS NINE CAVITIES, HENCE INVOLVEMENT OF TWO INDIVIDUAL STRIPS. INVESTIGATION BY THE CUSTOMER REVEALED THAT THERE WAS AN ENTRY IN THE EVENT LOG LIST SAYING THAT AHG WAS EMPTY, BUT THE RESULTS WERE NOT FLAGGED. OUR FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER FOUND THE INSTRUMENT WORKING PROPERLY. THE LEVEL DETECTION BOARD WAS REPLACED PREVENTIVELY. THERE IS NO FURTHER INDICATION FOR ANY INSTRUMENT MALFUNCTIONS. SINCE THE AMOUNT OF COOMBS REAGENT THAT IS ASPIRATED USUALLY SUFFICES FOR EIGHT CAVITIES (= ONE STRIP), WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE ASPIRATION COMPLETELY FAILED TWICE IN A ROW. TOGETHER WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THE REAGENT VIAL WAS QUALIFIED TO BE EMPTY BY THE SYSTEM AND SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT EXISTENT WHEN APPLYING VIALS WITH HIGHER VOLUME LEVEL, THIS STRONGLY SUGGESTS A SUBOPTIMAL TEACHING OF THE Z-MAX POSITION OF THE RIGHT PIPETTOR OF THE INSTRUMENT IN QUESTION. THIS IS OUR COMBINED INITIAL AND FINAL REPORT ON THIS INCIDENT.
5690723	1	the ehr mdds component fails to provide adequate notice that new lab results have been deposited; and more dangerous, there is zero notice that the silently deposited results have life threatening implications. in this case of atrial fibrillation being treated with heparin and being converted to coumadin (receiving both drugs), the hemoglobin was 7.0 g/dl on a 6 am blood draw. the result was in the silo of the ehr, but no one saw it because they all rounded earlier. it was more than 12 hours later that it was seen by a health care professional, during which time full heparin infusion continued. the heparin was stopped at the time the results were seen but the coumadin had already been administered. the next morning, the hemoglobin was less than 6 g/dl, the patient was bleeding from the gi tract, and there was incipient shock requiring icu transfer. the device was defective in that it failed to alert of new results, which resulted in delay of appropriate care.

HOWEVER, AS THIS PERIOD IS INSUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE MANUAL REPLACEMENT OF THE REAGENT, THE ACTUAL CONCENTRATION OF THE XYLENE IN BOTTLE 11 REMAINED UNCHANGED AT (B)(6) BECAUSE THE REAGENT HAD NOT BEEN REPLACED. BOTTLE 11 (XYLENE) WAS USED FOR THE FINAL CLEARING STEP OF PROTOCOL FROM WHICH SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING WAS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN DERIVED. THE MINIMUM FINAL REAGENT CONCENTRATION FOR XYLENE IS (B)(6). THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING XYLENE AT A CONCENTRATION LESS THAN THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR THE FINAL CLEARING STEP IN A PROTOCOL IS RE-INTRODUCTION OF WATER INTO THE TISSUE WHICH CANNOT BE DISPLACED IN SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING STEPS; AND CONTAMINATION OF THE REAGENTS USED IN THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING STEPS ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING REPORTED WAS A USE ERROR, WHICH OCCURRED PRIOR TO COMMENCEMENT OF THE AFFECTED PROTOCOL. SPECIFICALLY, THE USER FAILED TO COMPLETE THE MANUAL REAGENT REPLACEMENT PROCESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURER INSTRUCTIONS DETAILED IN THE (B)(6) PELORIS/PELORIS II USER MANUAL.

THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF BURN RESIDUE AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE OUTER BATTERY. THE BATTERIES HAD OVERHEATED TO THE POINT THAT THE PLASTIC LABEL COVER ON THE BATTERY BLISTERED AND STARTED PEELING AWAY FROM THE BATTERY CELL. THE BATTERIES APPEARED TO BE INSTALLED CORRECTLY DUE TO WHERE THE BURN MARKS WERE ON THE BATTERIES AND BATTERY COMPARTMENT. WE INSTALLED THE ORIGINAL OVERHEATED BATTERIES IN THE TELE BOX AND THE TRANSMITTER POWERED UP PROPERLY AND TRANSMITTER ECG TO THE PICC (CENTRAL STATION MONITOR). INSTALLING THE BATTERIES BACKWARDS IS POSSIBLE BUT THE WAY THE COMPARTMENT IS DESIGNED, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE A COMPLETED CIRCUIT. THERE IS NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE COMPARTMENT THAT WOULD'VE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. THIS WOULD MEAN THAT IMPROPERLY INSTALLED BATTERIES COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN. THERE WAS NOTHING THAT LOOKED PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH THE BATTERY CONTACTS OR THE COMPARTMENT. COMPARING THE DEFECTIVE TRANSMITTER TO A NEW TELEMETRY BOX, A NEW BOX HAS NO VOLTAGE ACROSS ANY BATTERY TERMINAL (WITH BATTERIES REMOVED) AND THE AFFECTED TRANSMITTER DIDN'T EITHER. THE BOX WAS ADMITTED TO A PHILIPS TELEMETRY TEST SETUP AND RAN FOR 75 MINS WITH NO HEAT ISSUES AT ALL. ONE POSSIBILITY FOR BATTERY OVERHEATING IS IF THE BATTERY CELL CASE HAD EXPOSED METAL ON BOTH BATTERIES AND THEY TOUCHED BY THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL SIDE. A NEW TELEMETRY BOX WAS SIMULATED WITH THIS CONDITION WHILE ADMITTED AND RUNNING AT A CENTRAL. THE BATTERIES CAN BE SHORTED, WHILE STILL SHOWING A WAVEFORM ON THE CENTRAL, WITH THE BATTERY DOOR CLOSED. THE BATTERIES WILL OVERHEAT WITHIN 10 MINS TO THE POINT THEY START SMELLING AND COULDN'T BE TOUCHED. THE TEST WAS STOPPED BEFORE ANY DAMAGE TO THE BOX OCCURRED. AFTER EVALUATING THE (B)(4) TELEMETRY BOX, THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS CAUSE FOR THIS CONDITION.

986027	1	ADD'L EVALUATION INCLUDED ENGINEERING REVIEW OF THE CODE THAT HANDLES MPR IMAGE ORIENTATION. AFTER INVESTIGATING THIS SITUATION, IT IS PHILIPS' OPINION THAT THERE IS MINIMAL RISK OF PT INJURY IF THE MPR (RECONSTRUCTED) IMAGE IS INCORRECTLY DISPLAYED IN ISITE PACS BECAUSE: THE ORIGINAL (CORRECT) IMAGE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN THE PT TIMELINE. THE ORIGINAL (CORRECT) IMAGE IS ALWAYS DISPLAYED ON THE MONITOR NEXT TO THE POSSIBLE INCORRECT IMAGE (NOT ALL MPRS ARE INCORRECT, ONLY THOSE IMAGES THAT ARE ACQUIRED AS DESCRIBED. ANATOMICAL MARKERS ARE OFTEN PRESENT (MAKING IDENTIFICATION OF THE INCORRECT DISPLAY LIKELY). ANY FINDINGS WOULD GENERATE ADD'L IMAGING PRIOR TO SURGERY OR ACTIVE INTERVENTION CONFIRMING ANATOMICAL LOCATION. THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE PRESENTED IN REPORTED MDR 295704-2008-00001 AND SUBJECT TO THE SAME CORRECTIVE RECALL (2954704-01042008-001). >< IN EARLY 2008, A CUSTOMER COMPLAINT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN USING ISITE PACS TO PERFORM MPR THE LEFT AND RIGHT ORIENTATION MARKERS WERE BEING DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE REVERSE ORIENTATION MARKER DISPLAY AFFECTS ONLY RECONSTRUCTED CORONAL AND SAGITTAL IMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, THE ORDERING OF CORONAL AND SAGITTAL IMAGE SLICES CAN ALSO BE REVERSE. FOR AN EXAMPLE, A SCOUT LINE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF AN AXIAL IMAGE COULD INTENTIONALLY DISPLAY THE CORRESPONDING SAGITTAL SLICE POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. SUBSEQUENT IN-HOUSE TESTING REVEALED THAT THE REPORTED ISSUE IS REPRODUCIBLE. THE ORIGINAL AXIAL SLICES ARE ALWAYS DISPLAYED AND ANNOTATED CORRECTLY IN ALL CASES. THE ORIGINAL DICOM IMAGES ARE ON ISITE PACS AND PRESENTED IN CORRECT ORIENTATION NEXT TO THE MPR IMAGES WHEN THEY ARE DISPLAYED ON THE MONITOR. THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF PT INJURY RELATED TO THIS ISSUE.

THIS MONITORING WAS VIEWED ON GE'S APEX PRO CLINICAL INFO CENTER (CIC) LOCATED ON THE ACUTE CARE UNIT AND ALSO CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED BY A MONITORING TECH IN THE TELEMETRY MONITORING UNIT (TMU). AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE, THE SPO2 READING DISAPPEARED FROM PT WINDOW ON CENTRAL INFO CENTER -CIC-'S FOR BOTH THE UNIT AND THE TMU. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE READING DOES NOT CAUSE AN ALARM TO SOUND AND IS NOT HIGHLIGHTED ON THE VIEWING SCREEN. IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE SPO2 READING HAD BEEN, THE TRANSCEIVER TX NUMBER IS VIEWABLE AS IF THE XPOD CABLE FOR THE SPO2 PROBE HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED. UPON VISUALIZATION OF GE'S DT-4500 FH TELEMETRY TRANSCEIVER, THE PULSE OXIMETRY PROBE LED LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED AND THE XPOD CABLE TO THE SPO2 PORT WAS SECURELY IN PLACE. THE XPOD CABLE WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW CABLE WITHOUT RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THE TRANSCEIVER WAS REPLACED WITH A DIFFERENT TRANSCEIVER AND IMMEDIATELY BOTH THE ECG AND THE SPO2 READING WERE RE-ESTABLISHED WITH THE CIC FOR BOTH UNIT AND TMU. THE TRANSCEIVER WAS SET ASIDE FOR TESTING BY GE. UPON FURTHER TROUBLESHOOTING, IF THE BATTERY IS REMOVED AND REPLACED, THE TRANSCEIVER WILL RESET ITSELF AND THE SPO2 READING WILL REAPPEAR AND NORMAL OPERATION IS RESTORED.

THIS ERROR MAY OCCUR DURING A SPECIFIC TIMING OF SOFTWARE SYSTEM EVENTS AND COMBINATION OF DOCUMENTED ACTIONS, AND PRECLUDED BY AN INTERRUPTION IN OUR APPLICATION SYSTEM UPDATE SERVICES THAT IS USUALLY CAUSED BY A NETWORK DISRUPTION. THE ERROR IS ONLY SEEN IN WORKFLOWS WHERE USERS DOCUMENT WITHIN THE SAME PT RECORD AT DIFFERENT WORKSTATIONS. AN INDICATION OF THE ERROR CONDITION WAS OBSERVED ON THE APPLICATION FLOWSHEET DISPLAY BY THE PRESENCE OF A RED STATUS ICON, WHICH IS NORMALLY USED TO INDICATE THE STATUS OF PENDING MEDICATION ORDER TASKS. HOWEVER, WHEN OPENING THE ORDER STATUS WINDOW THE PAGE WAS BLANK DUE TO THE SOFTWARE ERROR. REPORTS OF THIS ERROR CONDITION FROM CLIENTS ARE RARE, AS MULTIPLE SEQUENTIAL CONDITIONS MUST TAKE PLACE. A RESOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS ERROR IS AVAILABLE IN A CURRENT SOFTWARE SERVICE PACK. THE CUSTOMER WHO REPORTED THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO UPGRADE TO THE LATEST AVAILABLE SERVICE PACK. PICIS IS PRESENTLY EVALUATING THE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMER ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR SEEING THIS ERROR.
1425249	0	DRAEGER COMPLETED A COMPLETE EVAL OF THE REPORTED INCIDENT. THE ACTUAL COMPLAINT WAS RELATED TO THE BRACKET USED TO SECURE THE DRAEGER DELTA XL PT MONITOR AND NOT THE ACTUAL MONITOR. THE CITED MOUNTING ARM WITH PLATE WAS INSTALLED FOUR WEEKS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND BY THE CUSTOMER WITH ANY OF THE MOUNTING ARMS/PLATES THAT WERE INSTALLED AT THE SAME TIME OF THE CITED MOUNTING ARM/PLATE. THE CUSTOMER HAS REINSTALLED THE MONITOR AND ITS MOUNTING ARM ON THE MOUNTING WALL RACK AFTER DETERMINING THAT OPTICALLY NO PROBLEM COULD BE DETERMINED CONCERNING THE MONITOR MOUNTING PLATES AND THEIR FIXATION. THERE WAS NO RETURN OF THE MOUNTING ARM/PLATE TO DRAEGER MEDICAL FOR FURTHER EVAL PRIOR TO THIS REINSTALL. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE LOOSENING OF THE MONITOR'S MOUNTING ARM FROM THE MOUNTING'S WALL RACK APPEARS TO BE DUE TO USER ERROR (NOT CORRECTLY SECURING THE ARM TO THE WALL RACK). NO CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR SIMILAR REPORTS OF THIS CONDITION. >< IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE MONITOR, INCLUDING ITS MOUNTING, FELL DOWN NEAR THE PT'S HEAD. NO PT INJURY WAS REPORTED. (B) (4).

1550328	0	according to the user, tests were performed by the user facility's biomed dept on spo2 cable and nothing was found to be wrong with it, and it appeared to be working fine. the user returned both the spo2 cable and finger grip to the device manufacturer for additional evaluation. the device manufacturer visually examined both the spo2 cable and finger grip, and they were found to be normal. the finger grip was also turned inside out and examined under a microscope. there was no evidence of substance(s) that would have caused or contributed to a pt burn, such as metal flakes. the spo2 cable did not show evidence of overheating, and no metal particles/flakes were observed on the outside of the fiber optic ends or jacket. both the spo2 cable and finger grip were tested using the same model type monitor as that at the user facility. both the spo2 cable and finger grip functioned as expected during this testing. when tested using the returned spo2 cable and finger grip, the pt monitor displayed a normal spo2 waveform with 96% o2 and 78 bpm with a human finger inserted into the finger grip. the spo2 waveform produced by the pt monitor with the returned cable and finger grip was clean, with no noticeable anomalies. the device manufacturer asked the user if they thought the actual pt monitor malfunctioned. the user stated that they did not think the pt monitor malfunctioned and that they were only concerned about the spo2 cable and finger grip. the device manufacturer offered to send a field service rep to the user facility to evaluate the pt monitor. to date, the device manufacturer has not been notified of the user facility's desire to have the pt monitor evaluated. per the user, they continued to use the pt monitor, the spo2 cable and the spo2 finger grip that were in use during the reported incident, on pts after the reported incident. there is no evidence that the spo2 cable and finger grip caused or contributed to the pt's injury given the device manufacturer's evaluation of the returned product, along with the fact that the fiber optic cable and finger grip are nonconductive. it was reported that all of the pt's fingers (including the finger where the spo2 finger sensor was positioned) and part of the pt's palm was burned. this description of the pt's injury does not correlate with one that would have been caused by the pt monitor or an accessory of the pt monitor, and is in conflict with the initial report. the device manufacturer has requested copies of pictures that are available of the pt's injury. the user facility's risk manager has advised that the pt's family is not ready to release pictures of the pt's injury to the device manufacturer. a supplemental report will be filed if additional info is provided by the user facility or the pt's family, which impacts this report. >< it was reported to the device manufacturer that a pt was undergoing a head and cervical spine mri scan. and that spo2 was hooked up for monitoring. after the scan was complete, the user claimed that the pt immediately complained of burns on the hand where the spo2 finger grip was attached.

5886886	1	the (b)(6) public health newborn screening laboratory uses the (b)(6) specimen gate screening center (sgsc) software (a class i medical device) to store, retrieve, and process the data associated with specimen testing including but not limited to patient demographics, tests ordered, test results, test result determination (interpretation), quality control results, and result codes (flags) that may be associated with the specimen from its entry into the laboratory workflow until patient report is generated and released. when sgsc software is installed, configurable settings are programmed based on the customer preferences. for instance, each laboratory enters their specific population based reference ranges that are used to evaluate if a patient's test results are normal, below or above the reference range and require further action such as repeat testing. this laboratory specific logic automates the flow of the specimen through the laboratory. the customer defines the nomenclature used for their result codes (flags), and when the software encounters the predefined result code the software processes the specimen according to the logic associated with the result code. for instance in (b)(6) the result code tbc" means "to be confirmed". the software will apply this result code to an initial analytical result that is outside of the reference range. the software then based on the tbc result code flags the specimen as one which requires repeat testing to be performed. to perform the repeat testing  new punches of the dried blood spot specimen are required; the software identifies this to the customer. the software is configured during installation based on the procedural workflow of the laboratory. when a laboratory technician deviates from their routine procedural workflow the software may not be able to recognize the deviation and account/correct for the event if the specific procedural deviation wasn't defined in the software during installation. in this specific scenario a newborn sample was entered into sgsc by the laboratory  samples were punched from the dried blood spots and testing was completed for the (b)(6) defined disorder panel. one of the tests run by the laboratory  referenced as apga  generates results for both the galt and biotinidase markers. when the apga galt marker result is abnormal  a tgal screen is then ordered. the tgal test profile defined by (b)(6) includes running tests for tgal and galt markers. when the apga biotinidase result is abnormal  the apga assay is identified for repeat testing which would include repeat testing of the btd and galt markers. in this specific scenario both galt and biotinidase results were abnormal in the original apga assay and the laboratory repeated the btd marker  and within the tgal profile ran both tgal and galt. upon apga repeat  the biotinidase was normal  but galt remained abnormal. upon tgal testing the tgal was normal  but galt remained abnormal. the report should have resulted in an "abnormal" determination (galt repeat abnormal  tgal repeat normal)  however  on (b)(6) 2016 the reported result determination was "normal" for both galt and tgal. the correct disorder comment was included on the report by the laboratory: "test for galt enzyme defect is positive  which indicates possible galactosemia. if not previously contacted by the emory newborn screening follow-up program  please contact them at (b)(6)." a corrected report was released two days later on (b)(6) 2016. due to the abnormal screen report  a repeat specimen was received for testing and was tested on (b)(6). the repeat specimen tested normal for galt. in the reporting phase  sgsc evaluates result codes associated with the analytical result against a library of defined result codes which directs the software on which analytical result determination to print in the report. during sample punching an issue occurred which led to one of the confirmation apga assay to be identified as initial  producing tbc result codes. in the routine procedure workflow of the laboratory  the tbc result code (indicating initial test phase) should not reach the reporting phase and therefore is not defined in the result code library for reporting. in this situation  encountering an undefined result code in the reporting phase  sgsc is configured to use a default determination which is "normal". in the event there is more than one assay for a single marker  such as in this case for galt  the order in which the confirmation samples for the tests are punched dictates which result is printed in the report. the last assay run is reported by sgsc. in this case  it was the apga galt result reported on the original report. the laboratory chose to report the galt result from the tgal assay instead of the apga assay when the corrected report was created. both test results were abnormal for galt.><on (b)(6) 2015  (b)(6) initiated recall z-0166-2016 for specimen gate screening center. (b)(6) was issued the recall letter on (b)(6) and the signed response form was received the same day.  (b)(6)has been working with the (b)(6) newborn screening lab to identify the result code classifications impacted by the software anomaly.  since the recall issuance(b)(6) newborn screening lab have held routine meetings to identify and resolve the result code classifications. implementation of the final corrective action is targeted to be complete by (b)(6) 2016."

EVALUATION: UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM CORROSION WHICH CAN FURTHER DEVELOP INTO AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND; THE COPPER PRESENT IN THE GROUND STRAP WAS EXPOSED TO SODIUM AZIDE FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME TO FORM CORROSION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. INDEPENDENT STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS FOUND ON FIELD RETURNED GROUND STRAPS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COPPER AZIDE DEPOSITS, FORMATION RATES OF COPPER AZIDE, THE FEASIBILITY OF STAINLESS STEEL AS A POTENTIAL GROUND STRAP MATERIAL AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. ONE STUDY REVEALED THERE ARE OTHER METALS, POTENTIALLY UTILIZED IN INSTRUMENT DESIGNS, THAT MAY FORM AN UNSTABLE AZIDE COMPOUND ARE GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, BRASS AND TIN. (B)(4) PERFORMED A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF STEEL AND TIN AS REPLACEMENT FOR COPPER. THE STUDY INDICATED THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXPLOSIVE AZIDES FORMED IF STEEL, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NICKEL AND CHROMIUM, COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BUFFER SOLUTION. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM AZIDE WAS CONDUCTED. OTHER PARTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING COPPER WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER MATERIAL WITH NO KNOWN POTENTIAL VOLATILE METAL FORMATIONS. INSTRUMENT DESIGNS WILL AVOID THE USE OF BARE COPPER OR TIN COATED COPPER IN AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO SODIUM AZIDE MIGHT BE EXPECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. THE MATERIAL OF THE GROUND STRAP WAS CHANGED TO A (B)(4).

5201312	1	IT IS COMMON PROBLEM THAT TESTS ORDERED WITH CPOE INSTRUMENT AS PART OF THE EHR ARE NOT DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL. THIS IS DUE TO A FLAW IN THE CPOE SYSTEMS IN THAT IT FAILS TO ADEQUATELY NOTIFY THE RECIPIENT ANCILLARY SERVICE THAT A TEST HAS BEEN ORDERED. IN THIS CASE, THE PATIENT WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WAS ORDERED. IN THIS CASE, THE PATIENT WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WAS ORDERED AN EKG TO ASSESS ACUTE MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AND IT WAS NOT DONE FOR 14 HOURS AFTER IT WAS TO HAVE BEEN DONE, DELAYING DIAGNOSIS AND SPECIFIC TREATMENTS IN A CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT.

THE AIM SYSTEM ALERTED THE OPERATOR THAT THE INTERFACE WAS NOT COMING UP AND THE OPERATOR CHOSE NOT TO ADJUST THE PT'S HEMATOCRIT, BUT RATHER CONTINUED THROUGH THE ALARM. THIS RESULTED IN THE INTERFACE RUNNING QUITE LOW, KEEPING THE PLATELETS WELL AWAY FROM THE WASTE EXTRACTION LINE. PER AN ON-SITE INVESTIGATION, THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT THE SPECTRA OPTIC MACHINE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN PERIPHERAL PLATELET COUNT. THERE ARE NO PLATELETS ANYWHERE IN THE KIT AND THE RUN DATA LOG CONFIRMS THE INTERFACE'S BEHAVIOR AS SUCH.

6137378	0	investigation of this complaint found that a use error occurred at 16:40pm on (b)(6) 2016, when a user affirmed in the instrument software that the reagent concentration in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) was to be set to default value of 100%. the actual ethanol concentration in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) remained unchanged at 80.2%, because bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) had not been removed from the instrument for sufficient time to replace the reagent. as the instrument software uses reagent concentration to select reagent stations when a protocol is scheduled; the reagent station with the lowest (in-threshold) concentration of a reagent group or type is selected for the first step using that reagent group or type; and reagent stations of increasing concentration are used for the succeeding processing steps of the reagent group or type. reagent with the highest concentration is always used for the final processing step of a reagent group or type before changing to another reagent group or type. as a consequence, bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) was used for the final dehydration step of both the skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016. the minimum final reagent concentration required for ethanol is 98%. the consequences of using ethanol at a concentration less than the minimum required for the final dehydration step in a protocol is re-introduction of water into the tissue which cannot be displaced in subsequent processing steps; and contamination of reagents used in the subsequent processing steps  ultimately resulting in sub-optimal tissue processing. the tissue samples from the "skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016 would have been further adversely impacted by the reported use of the cleaning protocol as the first step in the regimen used to re-process these samples. use of the cleaning protocol to re-process samples is a use error as detailed in section 3.2 of the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual  which contains the following specific warning: "do not use cleaning protocols for reprocessing as the dry step will damage tissue." the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported from both the "bx and large runs" protocols executed on (b)(6) 2016 was a use error. specifically  a user failed to complete manual replacement of the reagent in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions detailed in the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual. the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual contains the following specific warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss." the tissue samples would have been further adversely impacted by the reported use of the cleaning protocol as the first step in the regimen used for re-processing of the affected samples. use of the cleaning protocol to re-process samples is also a use error as detailed in section 3.2 of the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual  which contains the following specific warning: "do not use cleaning protocols for reprocessing as the dry step will damage tissue." the root cause of the sub-optimal processing reported from a processing run(s) executed on both (b)(6) 2016 could not be determined from the information available.><leica biosystems received a complaint that tissue from a protocol run in retort b on the evening of (b)(6) 2016 was "not processing" and "pathologist says alcohol in xylene." the complainant also advised that the reagent in bottles 3 6  7 and 8 had been changed; "xylenes look good" and "waxes were not checked." on (b)(6) 2016  a leica field support specialist (fss) attended the laboratory in order to obtain further details of the circumstances involved in the complaint and to provide applications support. the complainant advised the fss that: "the first problem with processing occurred on (b)(6) 2016 on both the bx and large runs. the tissue came off both of these tissue runs seemed raw and not processed." the complainant also advised that the affected tissue samples from these protocols had been re-processed by "first running tissue through the cleaning cycle and then re-running the tissue program." the complainant reported that the following samples from the "skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and/or the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016 were undiagnosable: liver biopsy samples derived from three (3) male patients and one (1) female patient and one (1) prostate biopsy sample. the fss also documented that re-biopsy had been recommended for the patients for whom tissue was undiagnosable. the complainant also reported that intermittent processing issues  which were described by the pathologists as an artefact caused by "alcohol in the xylene on the tissue processor"  had been specifically reported by the pathologists on both (b)(6) 2016. on (b)(6) 2016  the fss confirmed that no further information would be provided regarding the five (5) patients for whom re-biopsy was recommended. as a consequence  neither an identifier nor the age/date of birth is available for the five (5) patients for whom re-biopsy was recommended. refer to mfr. report #8020030-2016-00083;

1878252	1	MEDWATCH, I AM WRITING THIS DUE TO A POTENTIAL PT SAFETY ISSUE. I WAS UNABLE TO FIND A GOOD MATCH FOR A DOCUMENT FORMAT ON YOUR WEBSITE FOR THIS PROBLEM AND I AM NOT SURE IF YOURS IS THE PROPER AGENCY TO CONTACT. IF NOT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO THE PROPER AGENCY. THE SAFETY ISSUE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR GIVING MULTIPLE MEDICATION DOSES TO PTS DUE TO A FLAW IN THE NEW ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMR) SYSTEM THAT IS BEING USED AT (B)(6) URGENT CARE FACILITIES IN (B)(6) WHERE I WORK. I WORK AT (B)(6) URGENT CARE. IT IS A RELATIVELY FAST PACED, HIGH PT VOLUME ENVIRONMENT. NURSES DOING TREATMENT AT THE FACILITY MAY SHARE THE CARE OF INDIVIDUAL PTS. MULTITASKING IS THE RULE. PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF USE OF EMR, A NURSE WOULD RECEIVE ORDERS FROM PROVIDERS ON PAPER. WHEN THE NURSE WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF A GIVEN ORDER, SUCH AS GIVING A MEDICATION, STARTING AN IV, DOING A LAB, ETC., HE OR SHE WOULD WRITE THEIR INITIALS NEXT TO THE ORDER. THIS WOULD PREVENT OTHER NURSES FROM COMING AND DOING THE SAME ORDER. WITH THE USE OF THE NEW PAPERLESS EMR SYSTEM THIS METHOD OF INFORMING COWORKERS THAT YOU HAVE DONE AN ORDER NO LONGER EXISTS. I WILL ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN. THERE IS A COMMON LIST OF PTS TO BE SEEN AND TREATED. ALL NURSES WORK FROM THIS LIST. TYPICALLY AT (B)(6) THERE WILL BE 2 OR 3 NURSES AND A MEDICAL ASSISTANT WORKING ON THE TREATMENT TEAM FOR A GIVEN SHIFT. THERE IS A COLOR CODED 'DOT' THAT APPEARS BEFORE THE NAME OF A PT INDICATING THAT A PROVIDER OR TRIAGE NURSE HAS ORDERED A PROCEDURE OR MEDICATION. A NURSE OR MA WILL SELECT THE PT FROM THE LIST, REMOVE THE DOT, AND GIVE THE MEDICATION OR DO THE PRESCRIBED PROCEDURE. AT THIS POINT, THERE IS NO PROBLEM. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THE MEDICATION WAS GIVEN IN THE LIST OF ORDERS FOR THAT PT, THE COLORED DOT IS GONE SO SUBSEQUENT NURSES LOOKING AT THE COMMON LIST OF PTS WOULD NOT BE PROMPTED TO GO IN AND TREAT THE PT. HOWEVER, IF A PROVIDER ORDERS ANOTHER MEDICATION OR PROCEDURE, THE DOT IN FRONT OF THAT PTS NAME REAPPEARS. A NURSE SEES THE DOT AND GOES INTO THE LIST OF ORDERS FOR THAT PT. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF WHICH ORDERS HAVE BEEN DONE, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHICH MEDICATIONS HAVE BEEN GIVEN. IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE NURSE TO 'DATA MINE' OTHER SECTIONS OF THE CHART AND, IF THE PREVIOUS NURSE HAS HAD TIME TO ENTER A PROGRESS NOTE, DETERMINE IF THE MEDICATION HAS BEEN GIVEN. IN THIS FAST PACED ENVIRONMENT THIS CAN BE OVERLOOKED. MOSTLY NURSES TRY TO COMMUNICATE VERBALLY WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TEAM TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ORDERS HAVE BEEN DONE. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TREATMENT TEAM MAY BE IN CLOSED ROOMS WITH PTS. ON MY FIRST DAY WORKING TREATMENT USING EMR (I NORMALLY WORK TRIAGE) I POINTED OUT THIS FLAW TO MY SUPERVISOR. SHE IN TURN BUMPED IT UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. ACCORDING TO THE FEEDBACK I HAVE RECEIVED, CORRECTING THIS FLAW HAS BECOME A 'TOP PRIORITY' FOR (B)(6). I WAS TOLD A HOSP REP WAS SENT TO THE SOFTWARE VENDOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE COMP PROGRAM FIXED SO THAT WHEN A NURSE GIVES A MEDICATION IT IS INDICATED IN THE ORDER QUEUE. AS OF THIS DATE, 6 WEEKS AFTER THE INITIATION OF THE EMR PROGRAM, THE SOFTWARE FLAW REMAINS. A TEMPORARY FIX, OUTLINED IN THE ATTACHED EMAIL DATED 09/16/2010, WAS SUGGESTED. I HAVE NOT OBSERVED THIS TEMPORARY FIX USED BY ANYONE, NOR HAVE I SEEN ANY ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE ITS USE. IF I CAN CLARIFY ANY PART OF THIS LETTER PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME. EMR MEDICATION ERROR AVOIDANCE: MANY OF YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF MEDICATION ERRORS IN LIGHT OF USING THE EMR. WE ARE WORKING WITH (B)(6) FOR A SYSTEM FIX, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, HAVE A MORE PEDESTRIAN PROCESS. AS SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE (WHICH WE WELCOME) WE WILL REVIEW AND IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATELY, BUT WOULD APPRECIATE IF ALL CLINICS WERE USING THE SAME PROCESS. IF THE PT MEETS ANTI-PYRETIC PROTOCOL AND IS GIVEN IBUPROFEN OR TYLENOL FROM TRIAGE - PUT A STICKY NOTE ON THE GREEN CHART AFTER ADMINISTRATION TO ALERT THE PERSON WHO ROOMS THE PT. WHEN THE PT IS ROOMED, WRITE 'TYLENOL OR MOTRIN GIVEN' ON THE WHITE BOARD ON THE PT'S ROOM SO THE MED IS NOT GIVEN A SECOND TIME. WHEN MEDICATIONS ARE ORDERED, THE NURSE WHO IS TAKING THE ORDER OFF SHOULD WRITE THE MEDICATION(S) ON THE WHITE BOARD BEFORE GIVING THE MED(S). AFTER THE POST-MED ASSESSMENT, THE MEDICATION SHOULD BE CROSSED OFF THE WHITE BOARD (NOT ERASED). THE MEDICATION SHOULD BE ERASED WHEN THE PT IS DISCHARGED FROM THE ROOM. IF A PT CHANGES ROOMS (I.E. COMES BACK FROM X-RAY TO A DIFFERENT ROOM) THE MEDS SHOULD BE WRITTEN ON THE BOARD AGAIN TO AVOID DUPLICATING MEDICATIONS. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO COME UP WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS AND WELCOME YOUR INPUT, BUT FEEL THAT THIS PROCESS WILL SERVE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PT SAFETY IMMEDIATELY.

4928763	1	THIS IS A COMMON AND WIDESPREAD PROBLEM AFFECTING MANY CASES. WHEN THE PATIENT'S EHR IS OPEN AND BEING SEARCHED FOR RADIOLOGY RESULTS, THERE IS A CAMERA ICON ON WHICH TO CLICK WHICH OPENS THE RADIOGRAPH IMAGES TO BE SEEN. THE PATIENT'S CHEST RADIOGRAPH WAS THE SUBJECT OF THIS QUERY. THE ICON WAS CLICKED AND A NORMAL APPEARING CHEST RADIOGRAPH APPEARED AND OTHER RESULTS WERE THEN ACCESSED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE RADIOGRAPH THAT APPEARED AND WAS NORMAL, WAS NOT OF THIS PATIENT, BUT OF SOME OTHER PATIENT THAT WAS NOT EVEN ON MY PATIENT LIST. THE PATIENT IN QUESTION HAD A RADIOGRAPH THAT INDICATED PULMONARY EDEMA AND WAS SOUGHT AFTER THE PHYSICAL LUNG EXAM WAS FOUND TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH A NORMAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH. THE DEFECTIVE PRESENTATION OF ANOTHER PATIENT'S RADIOGRAPH IS COMMON WITH THIS INTERFACE OF DEVICES BUT IF THE IMAGE WAS ALLOWED TO STAY ON THE SCREEN, THE CORRECT IMAGE OF THE RIGHT PATIENT WOULD LOAD. THIS DEFECT CAUSES MISDIAGNOSIS AND WRONG TREATMENTS.
5439907	0	the reported event was confirmed. initial visual inspection revealed no damages. the inability to cool was confirmed by reviewing the case data and the longer than normal cool time was due to a bad mixing pump. replaced the mixing pump with high pump hours and low pump speed and high speed because the pump motor was not keeping steady speed of the motor; the motor was going bad so it was replaced. the unit passed acats testing with burn in, electrical safety testing and a 3 day run period with bypass loop attached. a coin cell leakage test was performed and the unit passed. the coin cell battery was replaced for routine maintenance. the control panel passed final testing. software loaded. the device was returned to the customer. the device history record was reviewed and found nothing that could have caused or contributed to the reported event. the instructions for use state the following: the arctic sun? temperature management system is intended for monitoring and controlling patient temperature. warnings and cautions: warnings: do not use the arctic sun? temperature management system in the presence of flammable agents because an explosion and/or fire may result. do not use high frequency surgical instruments or endocardial catheters while the arctic sun? temperature management system is in use. there is a risk of electrical shock and hazardous moving parts. there are no user serviceable parts inside. do not remove covers. refer servicing to qualified personnel. power cord has a hospital grade plug. grounding reliability can only be achieved when connected to an equivalent receptacle marked ?hospital use? or ?hospital grade?. when using the arctic sun? temperature management system  note that all other thermal conductive systems  such as water blankets and water gels  in use while warming or cooling with the arctic sun? temperature management system may actually alter or interfere with patient temperature control. do not place arcticgel? pads over transdermal medication patches as warming can increase drug delivery  resulting in possible harm to the patient. cautions: this product is to be used by or under the supervision of trained  qualified medical personnel. federal law (usa) restricts this device to sale  by or on the order of a physician. use only distilled or sterile water. the use of other fluids will damage the arctic sun? temperature management system. when moving the arctic sun? temperature management system always use the handle to lift the controller over an obstacle to avoid over balancing. the patient?s bed surface should be located between 30 and 60 inches (75 cm and 150 cm) above the floor to ensure proper flow and minimize risk of leaks. the clinician is responsible to determine the appropriateness of custom parameters. when the system is powered off  all changes to parameters will revert to the default unless the new settings have been saved as new defaults in the advanced setup screen. for small patients (=30 kg) it is recommended to use the following settings: water temperature high limit =40??c (104??f); water temperature low limit =10??c (64.4 ??f); control strategy =2. the operator must continuously monitor patient temperature when using manual control and adjust the temperature of the water flowing through the pads accordingly. patient temperature will not be controlled by the arctic sun? temperature management system in manual control. due to the system?s high efficiency  manual control is not recommended for long duration use. the operator is advised to use the automatic therapy modes (e.g. control patient  cool patient  rewarm patient) for automatic patient temperature monitoring and control. the arctic sun? temperature management system will monitor and control patient core temperature based on the temperature probe attached to the system. the clinician is responsible for correctly placing the temperature probe and verifying the accuracy and placement of the patient probe at the start of the procedure. medivance recommends measuring patient temperature from a second site to verify patient temperature. medivance recommends the use of a second patient temperature probe connected to the arctic sun? temperature management system temperature 2 input as it provides continuous monitoring and safety alarm features. alternatively  patient temperature may be verified periodically with independent instrumentation. the displayed temperature graph is for general information purposes only and is not intended to replace standard medical record documentation for use in therapy decisions. patient temperature will not be controlled and alarms are not enabled in stop mode. patient temperature may increase or decrease with the arctic sun? temperature management system in stop mode. carefully observe the system for air leaks before and during use. if the pads fail to prime or a significant continuous air leak is observed in the pad return line  check connections. if needed  replace the leaking pad. leakage may result in lower flow rates and potentially decrease the performance of the system. the arctic sun? temperature management system is for use only with the arcticgel? pads. the arcticgel? pads are only for use with the arctic sun? temperature management systems. the arcticgel? pads are non-sterile for single patient use. do not reprocess or sterilize. if used in a sterile environment  pads should be placed according to the physician?s request  either prior to the sterile preparation or sterile draping. arcticgel? pads should not be placed on a sterile field. use pads immediately after opening. do not store pads once the kit has been opened. do not place arcticgel? pads on skin that has signs of ulceration  burns  hives  or rash. while there are no known allergies to hydrogel materials  caution should be exercised with any patient who has a history of skin allergies or sensitivities. do not allow circulating water to contaminate the sterile field when patient lines are disconnected. the water content of the hydrogel affects the pad?s adhesion to the skin and conductivity  and therefore  the efficiency of controlling patient temperature. periodically check that pads remain moist and adherent. replace pads when the hydrogel no longer uniformly adheres to the skin. replacing pads at least every 5 days is recommended. do not puncture the arcticgel? pads with sharp objects. punctures will result in air entering the fluid pathway and may reduce performance. if accessible  examine the patient?s skin under the arcticgel? pads often  especially those at higher risk of skin injury. skin injury may occur as a cumulative result of pressure  time and temperature. do not place bean bag or other firm positioning devices under the arcticgel? pads. do not place positioning devices under the pad manifolds or patient lines. the rate of temperature change and potentially the final achievable patient temperature is affected by many factors. treatment application  monitoring and results are the responsibility of the attending physician. if the patient does not reach target temperature in a reasonable time or the patient is not able to be maintained at the target temperature  the skin may be exposed to low or high water temperatures for an extended period of time which may increase the risk for skin injury. ensure that pad sizing / coverage and custom parameter settings are correct for the patient and treatment goals  water flow is greater than or equal to 2.3 liters per minute and the patient temperature probe is in the correct place. for patient cooling  ensure environmental factors such as excessively hot rooms  heat lamps  and heated nebulizers are eliminated and patient shivering is controlled. otherwise  consider increasing minimum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment. for patient warming  consider decreasing maximum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment. due to underlying medical or physiological conditions  some patients are more susceptible to skin damage from pressure and heat or cold. patients at risk include those with poor tissue perfusion or poor skin integrity due to diabetes  peripheral vascular disease  poor nutritional status  steroid use or high dose vasopressor therapy. if warranted  use pressure relieving or pressure reducing devices under the patient to protect from skin injury. do not allow urine  antibacterial solutions or other agents to pool underneath the arcticgel? pads. urine and antibacterial agents can absorb into the pad hydrogel and cause chemical injury and loss of pad adhesion. replace pads immediately if these fluids come into contact with the hydrogel. do not place arcticgel? pads over an electrosurgical grounding pad. the combination of heat sources may result in skin burns. if needed  place defibrillation pads between the arcticgel? pads and the patient?s skin. carefully remove arcticgel? pads from the patient?s skin at the completion of use. discard used arcticgel? pads in accordance with hospital procedures for medical waste. the usb data port is to be used only with a standalone usb flash drive. do not connect to another mains powered device during patient treatment. users should not use cleaning or decontamination methods different from those recommended by the manufacturer without first checking with the manufacturer that the proposed methods will not damage the equipment. do not use bleach (sodium hypochlorite) as it may damage the system. medivance will not be responsible for patient safety or equipment performance if the procedures to operate  maintain  modify or service the medivance arctic sun? temperature management system are other than those specified by medivance. anyone performing the procedures must be appropriately trained and qualified."

6137373	0	leica biosystems received a complaint that tissue from a protocol run in retort b on the evening of (b)(6) 2016 was not processing" and "pathologist says alcohol in xylene." the complainant also advised that the reagent in bottles 3 6  7 and 8 had been changed; "xylenes look good" and "waxes were not checked." on 08 november 2016  a leica field support specialist (fss) attended the laboratory in order to obtain further details of the circumstances involved in the complaint and to provide applications support. the complainant advised the fss that: "the first problem with processing occurred on (b)(6) 2016 on both the bx and large runs. the tissue came off both of these tissue runs seemed raw and not processed." the complainant also advised that the affected tissue samples from these protocols had been re-processed by "first running tissue through the cleaning cycle and then re-running the tissue program." the complainant reported that the following samples from the "skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and/or the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016 were undiagnosable: liver biopsy samples derived from three (3) male patients and one (1) female patient and one (1) prostate biopsy sample. the fss also documented that re-biopsy had been recommended for the patients for whom tissue was undiagnosable. the complainant also reported that intermittent processing issues  which were described by the pathologists as an artefact caused by "alcohol in the xylene on the tissue processor"  had been specifically reported by the pathologists on both (b)(6) 2016. on 10 november 2016  the fss confirmed that no further information would be provided regarding the five (5) patients for whom re-biopsy was recommended. as a consequence  neither an identifier nor the age/date of birth is available for the five (5) patients for whom re-biopsy was recommended. refer to mfr. report #8020030-2016-00083; 8020030-2016-00084; 8020030-2016-00086; and #8020030-2016-00087 for the other patients involved.><investigation of this complaint found that a use error occurred at 16:40pm on (b)(6) 2016  when a user affirmed in the instrument software that the reagent concentration in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) was to be set to default value of 100%. the actual ethanol concentration in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) remained unchanged at 80.2%  because bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) had not been removed from the instrument for sufficient time to replace the reagent. as the instrument software uses reagent concentration to select reagent stations when a protocol is scheduled; the reagent station with the lowest (in-threshold) concentration of a reagent group or type is selected for the first step using that reagent group or type; and reagent stations of increasing concentration are used for the succeeding processing steps of the reagent group or type. reagent with the highest concentration is always used for the final processing step of a reagent group or type before changing to another reagent group or type. as a consequence  bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) was used for the final dehydration step of both the "skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016. the minimum final reagent concentration required for ethanol is 98%. the consequences of using ethanol at a concentration less than the minimum required for the final dehydration step in a protocol is re-introduction of water into the tissue which cannot be displaced in subsequent processing steps; and contamination of reagents used in the subsequent processing steps  ultimately resulting in sub-optimal tissue processing. the tissue samples from the "skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016 would have been further adversely impacted by the reported use of the cleaning protocol as the first step in the regimen used to re-process these samples. use of the cleaning protocol to re-process samples is a use error as detailed in section 3.2 of the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual  which contains the following specific warning: "do not use cleaning protocols for reprocessing as the dry step will damage tissue." the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported from both the "bx and large runs" protocols executed on (b)(6) 2016 was a use error. specifically  a user failed to complete manual replacement of the reagent in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions detailed in the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual. the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual contains the following specific warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss." the tissue samples would have been further adversely impacted by the reported use of the cleaning protocol as the first step in the regimen used for re-processing of the affected samples. use of the cleaning protocol to re-process samples is also a use error as detailed in section 3.2 of the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual  which contains the following specific warning: "do not use cleaning protocols for reprocessing as the dry step will damage tissue." the root cause of the sub-optimal processing reported from a processing run(s) executed on both (b)(6) 2016 could not be determined from the information available."

AGFA WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS BEHAVIOR ON (B)(6) 2013, WHEN THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED AGFA. THERE WERE THREE (3) EVENTS LEADING UP TO AGFA'S AWARENESS: EVENT ONE: ON (B)(6) 2013, TWO HOSPITAL TECHNICIANS WERE IN AN ELEVATOR AND EXITING WITH THE DX-D 100 UNIT THAT WAS INSTALLED IN (B)(4) 2012. AS THEY STARTED TO MOVE FORWARD OUT OF THE ELEVATOR, THE UNIT SUDDENLY TURNED A HARD LEFT ON ITS OWN, THEN STRAIGHTENED OUT AND MOVED BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE TECHNICIANS. THE TECHNICIAN DRIVING THE UNIT LET GO OF THE HANDLE AND THE UNIT CONTINUED TO MOVE BACKWARDS UNTIL THE UNIT "PARTIALLY PINNED" THE TECHNICIANS TO THE ELEVATOR WALL. AS SOON AS THE UNIT CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE TECHNICIANS IT CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THE TECHNICIAN WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE UNIT FORWARD AND OUT OF THE ELEVATOR. NO ONE WAS INJURED BY THIS INCIDENT. THIS UNIT OPERATED WITH COMPLETE NORMAL MOVEMENT BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCIDENT. NO COMPLAINT WAS FILED BY THE CUSTOMER. EVENT TWO: ON (B)(6) 2013, TWO HOSPITAL TECHNICIANS WERE RETURNING THE SAME UNIT AS DESCRIBED IN EVENT ONE, TO ITS PARKING AREA FOR CHARGING. THE TECHNICIAN DRIVING THE UNIT, SUCCESSFULLY TURNED RIGHT AND THEN STRAIGHT FOR A FEW METERS, WHEN THE UNIT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND TURNED A HARD RIGHT. THE TECHNICIAN TRIED TO PULL THE UNIT BACK IN ORDER TO STRAIGHTEN THE UNIT'S DIRECTION, BUT THE UNIT GRAZED THE WALL. WHEN THIS OCCURRED, THE TECHNICIAN LET GO OF THE SWITCH AND THE UNIT STOPPED MOVING. NO ONE WAS INJURED BY THIS INCIDENT. THIS UNIT OPERATED WITH COMPLETE NORMAL MOVEMENT BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCIDENT. NO COMPLAINT WAS FILED BY THE CUSTOMER. EVENT THREE: ON (B)(6) 2013, A TECHNICIAN HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE EVENING SHIFT AND WAS USING THE SAME UNIT DESCRIBED IN EVENTS ONE AND TWO, FOR NEARLY 15 MINUTES. THE TECHNICIAN NEEDED TO ENTER THE ELEVATOR WITH THE UNIT AND PROCEEDED TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN INTO THE ELEVATOR. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REAR WHEELS OF THE UNIT CROSSED THE ELEVATOR THRESHOLD, THE UNIT SUDDENLY MOVED FORWARD ON ITS OWN AND THEN ACCELERATED UNEXPECTEDLY. THE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE UNIT BY PRESSING THE HANDLE AND FORCEFULLY PULLING BACK, BUT THE UNIT PROCEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD AT AN ACCELERATED RATE. THE UNIT TURNED SLIGHTLY RIGHT AND HIT THE REAR WALL OF THE ELEVATOR WITH FORCE AND STOPPED. THE TECHNICIAN RESTARTED THE UNIT AND ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE IT BACKWARDS OUT OF THE ELEVATOR. THE UNIT HAD NO FORWARD MOTION CAPABILITY AND ONLY MOVED BACKWARDS INTERMITTENTLY, AND IN SHORT SPURTS OF MOVEMENT. THE TECHNICIAN SMELLED SMOKE SOMETIME AFTER THE UNIT HIT THE ELEVATOR WALL. NO ALARMS OR WARNINGS WERE VISIBLE ON THE CONSOLE SCREEN. NO ONE WAS INJURED BY THIS INCIDENT. THE UNIT WAS REMOVED BY THE CUSTOMER AND NOT USED ANYMORE AFTER THIS 3RD EVENT. THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED AGFA THE NEXT DAY ON (B)(4) 2013 AND REQUESTED A COMPLAINT BE OPENED FOR THE EVENTS INVOLVED WITH THE PROBLEM DX-D 100 UNIT.

in general all of the set screws look inconspicuous. three pieces of a cord implanted at the levels t11-l3  a long and two short pieces  with unknown lot number were received. all of the cord pieces are slightly yellowish discolored and tissue attachments can partially be observed. the long piece shows the green thread marking of the working zone of the cord at one end which should not be implanted. the cord end shows a clear cut which is melted and merged. the other end is slightly bulged and the fibers of the outer layer seem to be frayed. three contact areas of the screws are clearly visible on the cord piece. the outer cord layer is slightly damaged in the contact areas where the tip of the set screw was placed. on the opposite side of two of the contact areas a dark spot can be observed which correlates with the cannulation of the cannulated pedicle screws. the second cord piece shows one contact area where the outer layer is slightly damaged. both ends exhibit a slightly bulged end with frayed and / or separated fibers from the outer cord layer. one cord end of the third cord piece shows a clear cut which is melted and merged. the other end exhibits a slightly bulged end with frayed and / or separated fibers. one contact area of the screws is visible right next to the slightly bulged end. no other damaged areas  e.g. worn areas  could be identified on the cord pieces. based on the appearance of the cord ends  the locations of the contact areas and the assumption that the clean cut ends are the ends of the entire implanted cord it was tried to reconstruct the cord. the five unknown staples show damage in form of nicks and scratches. the inner thread is mostly damaged and some of them exhibit bone ingrowth. one prong of a staple is fractured. conclusion: the dynesys top loading system used for vertebral body tether of the thoracolumbar spine was revised after approximately 2 years and 7 months in vivo due to a ruptured cord. the patient?s (b)(6) and can be classified according to the bmi scale as obese class i (moderately obese) ((b)(6)). contraindications of the dynesys spinal system and the zimmer dto implant are similar to other commercially available posterior spinal fixation systems including obesity. five unknown staples were received. with the available information at hand it stays unknown for what indication or where they were implanted. the cord was implanted at the levels t11-l3 and it was tried to reconstruct the cord. with the available information it stays unknown which cord end ended at t11 respectively at l3. therefore the anatomical location from where the individual pieces were removed stays unclear. two of the cord ends show a clear cut which are melted and merged while the fibers of the outer layer seem to be frayed on the remaining cord ends. based on the reconstructed cord two possible locations of a rupture could be identified. at those two locations the cord ends have similar bulged and frayed appearance that does not allow a clear identification of a rupture of the cord. the per states a cord rupture in between two screws while the returning explanted materials form lists ruptured vertebral body tether. therefore it is unclear if the cord possibly ruptured in one or two locations. the appearance of the cord ends and the information at hand are not sufficient to conclude if and where a rupture of the cord might have occurred. the reason for a possible cord rupture stays unknown. from the available information it can be concluded that the surgeon performed a vertebral body tethering (vbt) for idiopathic scoliosis as described by (b)(6) et al.. this is off label use of the dynesys top loading system. as the surgical intentions of vbt differ from those of the dynesys system?s intended uses  it is also unknown if the cord tensioning during the implantation surgery might have influenced the cord rupture or if the cord tensioned over the time in vivo due to growing of the patient might have been a contributing factor. in conclusion it is hypothesized that the following possible factors might have contributed to the cord rupture either alone or in combination: - cord tensioning during the implantation surgery  - cord tensioned over the time in vivo due to growing of the patient  - the system being in an unknown/untested loading environment  - the patient?s overweight. however  an exact root cause could not be identified. the need for corrective actions is not indicated and zimmer (b)(4) considers this case as closed.

2803857	1	THIS IS REGARDING SOFTWARE USED IN AN EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION CENTER BY DISPATCHERS TO PINPOINT CORRECT LOCATIONS FOR DISPATCH OF EMERGENCY VEHICLES. A 911 CALL FROM AN ACCIDENT SCENE RESULTED IN DISPATCH OF AN AMBULANCE AND HELICOPTER TO AN INCORRECT LOCATION. THE STREET ADDRESS AND CITY NAME HAD BEEN ENTERED CORRECTLY INTO THE SYSTEM WHICH RETURNED TWO IDENTICAL ADDRESSES THAT RANKED EQUALLY. THE FIRST ADDRESS OF THE TWO LISTED WAS SELECTED BECAUSE BOTH RANKED 99% AND BOTH ADDRESSES IN THE GEOCODER WERE IDENTICAL. UPON ARRIVAL TO THAT ADDRESS, AN ACCIDENT SCENE WAS NOT ABLE TO BE FOUND. IT WAS THEN THAT THE DISPATCHER REALIZED THE TWO EXACT ADDRESSES WITH THE SAME MATCH RANKING WERE PHYSICALLY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. DUE TO ERRONEOUS MAP DATA THAT HAD BEEN SUPPLIED FROM THE COUNTY AND THE DEFAULT SORTING CONFIGURATION OF THE COLUMN, THE ADDRESS THAT CAME UP FIRST AND CHOSEN BY THE DISPATCHER, WAS INCORRECT. AS A RESULT, THE RESPONSE TO THE SCENE WAS DELAYED. THE PATIENT EXPIRED AT THE SCENE, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE PATIENT'S EXTENSIVE INJURIES, IT WAS DETERMINED THE DELAY DID NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME. A REVIEW OF THIS IDENTIFIED THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN INTERSECTION/RANGE LIMITS BETWEEN THE TWO ADDRESSES BUT THE ACTUAL GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE ADDRESS WAS WITHIN BOTH THE INTERSECTION/RANGE LIMITS. THE MANUFACTURER OF THE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN CONTACTED AND EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS OCCURRED REGARDING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SOFTWARE AND THE INTEGRATION OF MAP OVERLAYS WITH THEIR SOFTWARE. SINCE THE EVENT DESCRIBED ABOVE THE ECC HAS ENCOUNTERED THE GEOCODER PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL ADDRESS WITH IDENTICAL STREET INFORMATION, IDENTICAL 99% RANKING AND IDENTICAL INTERSECTION/RANGE LIMITS BUT WITH TWO PHYSICALLY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. THIS SITUATION DID NOT RESULT IN ANY DELAYS IN PATIENT CARE. ERRONEOUS MAP DATA SUPPLIED BY THE COUNTY CONTRIBUTED TO THE GEOCODER MATCHES.OUR CONCERNS ARE:1. TWO ADDRESSES WITH DIFFERENT INTERSECTION/RANGE LIMITS WERE RANKED EQUALLY.  2. THE ADDRESS THAT WAS THE "BEST" MATCH, WAS LISTED SECOND IN BOTH SITUATIONS DESCRIBED HERE.  3. TWO DISTINCT PHYSICAL ADDRESSES CAN APPEAR IN THE GEOCODER WITH EXACT ADDRESS INFORMATION, EXACT INTERSECTION/RANGE LIMITS AND EQUAL RANKING.  4. THE "PREVIEW" FUNCTION WILL SHOW DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS IN THESE SITUATIONS BUT IS AN OPTIONAL FIELD.  5. DEFAULT GEOCODER CONFIGURATION OF DATA WAS NOT PROVIDED TO ECC STAFF.  6. A MANUFACTURER PUBLISHED USERS GUIDE FOR THE GEOCODING TOOL HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED TO THE ECC.SINCE THIS EVENT, ZOLL HAS PROVIDED THE RECOMMENDED GEOCODER CONFIGURATION.

THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WHITE BLOOD CELL (RWBC) TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THE DISPOSABLE SET IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE IT WAS DISCARDED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE WBC COUNT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.><INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. ROOT CAUSE: THE RUN DATA FILE ANALYSIS DID NOT SHOW A CONCLUSIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. THE RUN WAS EVENT FREE, WITH NO ADJUSTMENTS OR CHANGES IN PUMP SPEED MADE DURING THE PROCEDURE. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS LEUKO REDUCTION FAILURE MAY BE DONOR RELATED. ANALYSIS OF THE RBC DETECTOR SIGNAL SHOWED THAT PLATELETS TOOK LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO INITIALLY EXIT THE LRS CHAMBER. THIS MEANS THAT THERE WAS A DELAY BETWEEN WHEN THE TRIMA ACCEL DEVICE PREDICTED THAT PLATELETS WERE COLLECTING AND WHEN THEY ACTUALLY STARTED COLLECTING. THE CONCENTRATION OF PLATELETS GOING BY THE RBC DETECTOR WAS CONTINUALLY LOWER THAN WHAT THE TRIMA ACCEL DEVICE PREDICTED THROUGHOUT THE RUN. THIS LOW YIELD COLLECTION MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO INACCURATE ENTRY OF THE DONOR INFORMATION, IMPROPER LOADING OF THE DISPOSABLE IN THE CENTRIFUGE OR AN INACCURATE YSF VALUE. ALTHOUGH NOT CONCLUSIVE, A DONOR RELATED PHENOMENON MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS LOW YIELD FAILURE.

2453953	1	DURING THE EARLY MORNING OF A RECENT NIGHT SHIFT, ALL OF THE OBIX BEDS WENT TO A "HOLD" CONDITION, RESULTING IN LOSS OF MONITORNIG FOR THE PATIENTS IN THE 27 BED UNIT. WHEN OBIX TECH SUPPORT WAS CALLED, WE WERE TOLD THAT THEIR TECHNICIAN WAS ON ANOTHER CALL AND TO CALL BACK IN 20MIN IF WE DID NOT HEAR FROM THEM. APPROXIMATELY 25 MINUTES LATER THE BEDS STARTED TO COME BACK ON LINE AND BY 30 MINUTES AFTER THE CALL, ALL BEDS AND CENTRAL MONITORING WAS BACK ON-LINE. OBIX ORIGINALLY ATTRIBUTED THIS FAILURE TO THEIR SYSTEM NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCEPT THE TIME CHANGE PUSH (CHANGE FROM DST TO STANDARD TIME). LATER WE WERE TOLD THIS IS NORMAL BUT SHOULD TAKE LESS THAN ONE MINUTE TO COMPLETE. WE THINK THIS IS ANOTHER DESIGN FLAW AND IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT OBIX SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED AT INSTALLATION.APPROXIMATELY 12 HOURS LATER ON THE SAME DATE, OBIX BEDS AGAIN WENT TO A BED HOLD STATUS. OBIX TECH SUPPORT WAS CALLED AND THEY ADVISED THAT ALL OF THE OBIX SERVICES HAD SHUT DOWN FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. OBIX STARTED THEM REMOTELY AND 30 MINUTES LATER THE SYSTEM WAS BACK ON LINE.

IT HAS NOT OCCURRED SINCE.======================MANUFACTURER RESPONSE FOR PERINATAL DATA SYSTEM, OBIX (PER SITE REPORTER).======================SEE EVENT DESCRIPTION. 
1421934	1	UNDER SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT HAVE STRINGENT MFG TIME LIMITS, IF A COMPONENT WAS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF SPECIFIED TIME LIMITS, THE SYSTEM MAY NOT PREVENT IT FROM BEING DISTRIBUTED. THIS PROBLEM CAN OCCUR IF BLOOD DONATION INFO FROM A MOBILE COLLECTION IS UPLOADED TO THE SOFTWARE AFTER THE COMPONENT HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED IN THE SYSTEM. IF THE BLOOD DONATION INFO HAS BEEN INPUT INTO THE SYSTEM BEFORE THE COMPONENT IS CREATED IN THE SYSTEM, THEN THE SOFTWARE WILL FLAG THE COMPONENT AS LATE PRODUCTION AND PREVENT IT FROM BEING DISTRIBUTED. AS A WORKAROUND, THE USER FACILITIES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO ENTER DONATION INFO FROM MOBILE COLLECTIONS USING DIFFERENT REGISTRATION SCREEN(S) OF THE SOFTWARE. A SAFETY ADVISORY, WHICH INCLUDED THE WORKAROUND, WAS DISTRIBUTED TO CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, AN URGENT SOFTWARE FIX HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. >< DEVICE EVAL: SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE EVAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM WAS ISOLATED TO ONE BRANCH OF LOGIC IN THE SOURCE CODE IN A SINGLE PROGRAM UNIT. THE PROBLEM IS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM NOT USING THE CORRECT DATES TO DECIDE WHETHER A PRODUCT QUALIFIES FOR THE LATE PRODUCTION PROHIBITING FACTOR, I.E., THOSE PRODUCTS THAT MUST BE MANUFACTURED WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF HOURS OR DAYS. THE PROGRAM SHOULD PASS TWO DATES TO THE CONTROL LOGIC BUT THE SYSTEM WAS PASSING ONLY ONE DATE. A CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE LOGIC TO CORRECTLY PASS DATES TO THE COMPONENT LATE PRODUCTION PROCESS DURING THE UPLOAD DONOR LINK PROCESS. ALL OTHER POSSIBLE BRANCHES OF THE LOGIC WERE REVIEWED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOFTWARE IS PASSING THE CORRECT DATES. RISK ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHAT OTHER FUNCTIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION WAS VERIFIED AND VALIDATED. THE SCOPE OF THE TESTING INCLUDED THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION ITSELF, ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED AREAS OF THE SOFTWARE, AND OTHER REGRESSION TESTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FIX WAS EFFECTIVE AND DID NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SOFTWARE. THE TESTED SOFTWARE MODIFICATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO CLIENTS THE WEEK OF MARCH 23, 2009.

(B)(6) COMPLAINED OF REPORT THAT THE SHIELD ¿FELL¿ OFF THE C-VIEW MONITOR THIS MORNING. IT ¿BRUSHED¿ THE PATIENT ON THE WAY DOWN AND SMASHED ON THE FLOOR. NO ONE WAS HURT. (B)(6) MEDICAL CENTER COMPLAINED THAT ¿SHIELD FELL OFF THE DISPLAY. IT WAS STATED THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS MOVING THE DISPLAY BY THE SHIELD VS. THE HANDLES OR THE BEZEL.¿ (B)(6) UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL COMPLAINED THAT THE ¿SHIELD FELL OFF THE DISPLAY. A LARGE CRACK WAS CREATED DOWN THE MIDDLE AND THE BINDING CORNERS ARE ALSO CRACKED.¿ INVESTIGATION BY CARROT MEDICAL CONFIRMED THAT THE METHOD OF ATTACHING THE GLARE SHIELDS TO THE BEZEL WITH ADHESIVE IS NOT SUFFICIENT. USERS HAVE INCORRECTLY BEEN PULLING ON THE GLARE SHIELDS TO POSITION THE DISPLAY RATHER THAN THE HANDLES PROVIDED ON THE DISPLAY ITSELF. MOST GLARE SHIELDS IN THE FIELD HAVE BEEN SECURED MECHANICALLY. THE SHIELDS THAT FAILED WERE NOT SECURED MECHANICALLY, BUT RATHER ADHESIVELY. ALL THOSE SHIELDS SECURED WITH ADHESIVE ARE BEING RETROFITTED WITH A MECHANICAL ATTACHMENT METHOD. ADHESIVE IS NO LONGER USED ON NEW SYSTEMS.

4960870	1	NO PATIENT INCIDENT REPORTED AT THIS MOMENT - THIS ISSUE IS DOCUMENTED AS A PRECAUTION. FIVE RELATED CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS ((B)(4)) WERE REGISTERED AND INVESTIGATED FROM OCT 2014 TO JUNE 2015 FOR RELATED ISSUES. THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE COMPLAINTS LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF ISSUES WITH IMAGE INGESTION. BUGS IDENTIFIED: (B)(4) LDS: LDS: FAILED TO INGEST IMAGE WITH OVERLAYS BELONGING TO 60XX GROUP HAVING ALPHANUMERIC ID (IE, 600A) (B)(4) LDS: ROWS STUCK IN INCOMING_FILES DUE TO FILES MISSING IN THE INCOMING FILES FOLDER. INVESTIGATION: INVESTIGATION OF THE LOGS IN (B)(4) REVEALED THAT SOME OF THE EXPECTED OVERLAY FILES WERE NOT FOUND ON THE FILE SYSTEM; THIS LED TO DISCOVERY OF THE MISSING FILES LEFT BEHIND AT AN EARLIER STAGE OF IMAGE INGESTION. ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM: DUE TO THE ASYNCHRONOUS NATURE OF IMAGE INGESTION PROCESSING, A FAILURE AT THE EARLY STAGES OF THE INGESTION PROCESS CAN LEAD TO IMAGES NOT BEING VISIBLE TO THE END USER. THERE IS NO INDICATION TO THE USER THAT THIS HAS OCCURRED. REASON FOR POSSIBLE PATIENT SAFETY: THE RADIOLOGIST MAY PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS WITHOUT BEING AWARE THAT IMAGES ARE MISSING. DESIGN MITIGATION TO REDUCE THE RISK: PROPOSED NEW MITIGATION: THE PACS WILL REPORT PROBLEMS INGESTING IMAGES AND INDICATE SUCH ISSUES TO THE USER ((B)(4)). THIS MITIGATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN A COMING SOFTWARE RELEASE. (B)(4): LDS: EXPOSE BROKEN SERIES TO USER (WARN ABOUT ADDITIONAL IMAGES PENDING INGESTION WHEN VIEWING IMAGES). DETECTABILITY OF PROBLEM: UNTIL THE SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT WILL INCLUDE THE PROPOSED MITIGATION IS INSTALLED ON THE CLIENT'S SYSTEM, THE USER MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT SOME IMAGES MAY BE MISSING. HOWEVER, IF THE CLIENT'S SYSTEM HAS OTHER MECHANISMS TO VERIFY IMAGE COUNT BETWEEN SOURCE AND DESTINATION, THEN THE USER MIGHT BE ABLE TO KNOW ABOUT THE DISCREPANCY.><IN ORDER TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE, INTELERAD WILL: PROVIDE THE AFFECTED CLIENTS WITH A LIST OF STUDIES THAT WERE AFFECTED AND POSSIBLY RECOVER THE MISSING IMAGES. DEPLOY A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT INCLUDES A FIX AND MITIGATION TO ALL CLIENTS WHERE THE ISSUE COULD POTENTIALLY OCCUR. THIS WILL BE DONE TENTATIVELY. PERIODICALLY AUDIT ALL AFFECTED CLIENT, ANY NEW OCCURRENCES OF THIS ISSUE UNTIL THE MITIGATION (SOFTWARE UPDATE) IS IN PLACE. THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WILL INCLUDE ONLY BUG FIXES - YOUR WORKFLOW WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. THE UPDATE WILL RESULT IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES OF DOWNTIME PER SERVER AS WE PERFORM A FULL SERVICE RESTART. IMPACT ON USERS WILL BE MINIMAL, IF ANY. CORRECTIVE ACTION CALENDAR: FOR ALL CLIENTS WITH PACS VERSION 4-5-1 OR HIGHER, THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WILL BE DEPLOYED WITHIN A TIMEFRAME TO BE AGREED WITH CLIENTS (COMPLETION ESTIMATED BY END OF MARCH 2016).

THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION PROVIDED AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE IF A MALFUNCTION WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY OCCURRED. INVESTIGATION: PER THE CUSTOMER, THE PLATELET CONTAMINATION WAS NOTED FOLLOWING AN UPGRADE OF THE DEVICE. THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN NOTED A DEFECTIVE TEST CASSETTE UPON RETURNING TO CALIBRATE THE DEVICE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO FURTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DEVICE REGARDING THE REPORTED CONDITION SINCE THE RE-CALIBRATION. ROOT CAUSE: THE LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE PLATELET CONTAMINATION IS A CALIBRATION ISSUE WITH THE RED BLOOD CELL DETECTOR DUE TO A WORN TEST CASSETTE USED FOR THE ORIGINAL CALIBRATION. CORRECTION: A NEW TEST CASSETTE WAS OBTAINED AND THE DEVICE WAS CALIBRATED AS APPROPRIATE.><.

2605109	1	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

3449913	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(6). THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY.><INVESTIGATION: THE DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN AND INVESTIGATION. THE RUN DATA FILE WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RUN DATA FILE DID NOT FIND A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. NO UNUSUAL PROCESS VARIABLE WAS IDENTIFIED AND THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE INDICATE THAT THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM OPERATED AS INTENDED.

THE PT WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WAS RECEIVING HEPARIN SUBCUTANEOUSLY AWAITING A THERAPEUTIC WARFARIN DOSE TO ACHIEVE AN INR BETWEEN 2 AND 3. THE INR REACHED THAT GOAL AND WAS DELIVERED TO THE (B)(4) BY THE TESTING LAB. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS (B)(4) DEVICE IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN SO FAR AS IT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WARNING THAT NEW RESULTS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED. UNLESS SOMEONE IS CONTINUOUSLY SCANNING THE (B)(4) FOR NEW RESULTS, THIS DEFECT DE-FACTO RESULTS IN DELAYS IN CARE WITH ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF SAID DELAY DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE INTRINSIC SEVERITY OF THE PTS' ILLNESS AND CO-MORBIDITIES. NO ONE ON THE MEDICAL TEAM NOR THE (B)(4) DEVICE THAT ENABLED CONCOMITANT AND ANTICOAGULANTS BECAME AWARE OF THAT THERAPEUTIC INR FOR 24 HOURS AND THE HEPARIN DOSES CONTINUED FOR HOURS CONCOMITANTLY WITH WARFARIN. LIFE THREATENING BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS ENSUED RESULTING FROM AT LEAST 3 MORE SHOTS THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN HAD THE INR BEEN KNOWN, THIS ESCAPED THE NURSES, THE PHARMACISTS, AND THE HOSPITALISTS. ONCE THE BLEEDING WAS IDENTIFIED, REVERSAL OF THE INR WAS ATTEMPTED WITH FRESH FROZEN PLASMA AND VITAMIN K. A PTT WAS ORDERED AND THE RESULT OF GREATER THAN 130 WAS SILENTLY DEPOSITED IN TO THE (B)(4). THE SURGICAL CONSULTANTS, NURSES, PHARMACISTS, AND HOSPITALISTS DID NOT SEE THAT RESULT AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN FOR MORE THAN 12 HOURS AFTER THAT RESULT BECAME AVAILABLE. THE PT CONTINUED TO BLEED. AGAIN, THERE WAS NOT ANY NOTIFICATION THAT A NEW LIFE-THREATENING RESULT BECAME AVAILABLE. IF ANY MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL TEAM OPENED AND LOOKED - SEVERAL DID NOT - AT THE (B)(4), THE RESULT WAS MISSED, WE SUSPECT DUE TO HUMAN FACTORS ESPECIALLY, THE USER UNFRIENDLY PRESENTATION OF RESULTS ON THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE. THE PT REMAINS CRITICALLY ILL FROM THE BLEED, AND WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED FROM EARLY TREATMENT HAD THE DELAYS DUE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN THE (B)(4) AND (B)(4) DEVICE(S). 
1404752	1	we have discovered a problem with healthcare computer; retail pharmacy management system. a prescription was entered into the synercom system and a picture of the label and the prescription were scanned into the ez-flow system. the patient instructions were consistent in all 3 places. then we used the system to fax the doctor for refills and the patient instructions came out of the system different. the correct directions were 'use one syringe 7.5mg as needed for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes'. the directions on the fax read 'use 1 syringe //7.5mg// as needed for seizures lasting give 1 tablet by mouth once'. the last part was somehow substituted by the system. if the fax record was used to create a new prescription then instructions could be wrong creating a possible risk to the patient due to overdose, underdose or wrong route, etc.. we have seen this kind of behavior in this system before and reported it to the company. last october we had a patient prescription that had instruction that read 'give 0.4ml by mouth three times daily'. the patient decided to not pick up the prescription so it was placed on hold in the system. so 8 days later, the patient decided to fill the prescription. when we processed the prescription from hold, without modifying it, the instructions read 'every 4 to 6 hours as needed for seizures'. so the same thing happened with the same kind of risk involved.

THE VACUUM ACCUMULATOR #1 WAS FOUND TO BE DAMAGED, AND THE VACUUM PUMP BECAME WET WITH DILUENT REAGENT; BOTH PARTS WERE REPLACED. UPON INSTRUMENT INITIALIZATION, IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE MONITOR WOULD NOT DISPLAY ANY IMAGE. THE INSTRUMENT WAS TESTED WITH A GENERIC MONITOR, WHICH WORKED. THE MONITOR WAS REPLACED AND THE INSTRUMENT WAS RETURNED INTO AN OPERABLE STATUS. THE FSR STATED THAT THE MONITOR WAS THE PROBABLE SOURCE OF THE SMOKE DURING THE EVENT, SINCE IT DID NOT COME ON AFTER INSTRUMENT INITIALIZATION. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS REQUIRED.

(b)(4) recommends the use of a second patient temperature probe connected to the arctic sun? temperature management system temperature 2 input as it provides continuous monitoring and safety alarm features. alternatively  patient temperature may be verified periodically with independent instrumentation; the displayed temperature graph is for general information purposes only and is not intended to replace standard medical record documentation for use in therapy decisions; patient temperature will not be controlled and alarms are not enabled in stop mode. patient temperature may increase or decrease with the arctic sun? temperature management system in stop mode; carefully observe the system for air leaks before and during use. if the pads fail to prime or a significant continuous air leak is observed in the pad return line  check connections. if needed  replace the leaking pad. leakage may result in lower flow rates and potentially decrease the performance of the system; the arctic sun? temperature management system is for use only with the arcticgel? pads; the arcticgel? pads are only for use with the arctic sun? temperature management systems; the arcticgel? pads are non-sterile for single patient use. do not reprocess or sterilize. if used in a sterile environment  pads should be placed according to the physician request  either prior to the sterile preparation or sterile draping. arcticgel? pads should not be placed on a sterile field; use pads immediately after opening. do not store pads once the kit has been opened; do not place arcticgel? pads on skin that has signs of ulceration  burns  hives  or rash; while there are no known allergies to hydrogel materials  caution should be exercised with any patient who has a history of skin allergies or sensitivities; do not allow circulating water to contaminate the sterile field when patient lines are disconnected; the water content of the hydrogel affects the pad adhesion to the skin and conductivity  and therefore  the efficiency of controlling patient temperature. periodically check that pads remain moist and adherent. replace pads when the hydrogel no longer uniformly adheres to the skin. replacing pads at least every 5 days is recommended; do not puncture the arcticgel? pads with sharp objects. punctures will result in air entering the fluid pathway and may reduce performance; if accessible  examine the patient skin under the arcticgel? pads often  especially those at higher risk of skin injury. skin injury may occur as a cumulative result of pressure  time and temperature. do not place bean bag or other firm positioning devices under the arcticgel? pads. do not place positioning devices under the pad manifolds or patient lines; the rate of temperature change and potentially the final achievable patient temperature is affected by many factors. treatment application  monitoring and results are the responsibility of the attending physician. if the patient does not reach target temperature in a reasonable time or the patient is not able to be maintained at the target temperature  the skin may be exposed to low or high water temperatures for an extended period of time which may increase the risk for skin injury. ensure that pad sizing / coverage and custom parameter settings are correct for the patient and treatment goals  water flow is greater than or equal to 2.3 liters per minute and the patient temperature probe is in the correct place. for patient cooling  ensure environmental factors such as excessively hot rooms  heat lamps  and heated nebulizers are eliminated and patient shivering is controlled. otherwise  consider increasing minimum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment. for patient warming  consider decreasing maximum water temperature  modifying target temperature to an attainable setting or discontinuing treatment; due to underlying medical or physiological conditions  some patients are more susceptible to skin damage from pressure and heat or cold. patients at risk include those with poor tissue perfusion or poor skin integrity due to diabetes  peripheral vascular disease  poor nutritional status  steroid use or high dose vasopressor therapy. if warranted  use pressure relieving or pressure reducing devices under the patient to protect from skin injury; do not allow urine  antibacterial solutions or other agents to pool underneath the arcticgel? pads. urine and antibacterial agents can absorb into the pad hydrogel and cause chemical injury and loss of pad adhesion. replace pads immediately if these fluids come into contact with the hydrogel; do not place arcticgel? pads over an electrosurgical grounding pad. the combination of heat sources may result in skin burns; if needed  place defibrillation pads between the arcticgel? pads and the patient?s skin; carefully remove arcticgel? pads from the patient?s skin at the completion of use. discard used arcticgel? pads in accordance with hospital procedures for medical waste; the usb data port is to be used only with a standalone usb flash drive. do not connect to another mains powered device during patient treatment; users should not use cleaning or decontamination methods different from those recommended by the manufacturer without first checking with the manufacturer that the proposed methods will not damage the equipment. do not use bleach (sodium hypochlorite) as it may damage the system; (b)(4) will not be responsible for patient safety or equipment performance if the procedures to operate  maintain  modify or service the (b)(4) arctic sun? temperature management system are other than those specified by (b)(4). anyone performing the procedures must be appropriately trained and qualified."

3289303	1	PATIENT WITH PERMANENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND LABILE RATE WAS ON A NEGATIVE CHRONOTROPIC MEDICATION CALLED DIGOXIN THAT WAS TITRATED AS AN OUT PATIENT IN THE CLINIC TO A DOSE OF .125 MG ON MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY TO KEEP THE HEART RATE BETWEEN 60 AND 85 BEATS PER MINUTE. THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A MEDICAL CONDITION. THE SUNRISE CPOE DEVICE HAS A DROP-DOWN MENU TO ORDER DOSING INTERVALS, WITHOUT A MANUAL OVER RIDE. THE DROP-DOWN MENU AND OVER 50 OPTIONS FOR DOSING INTERVALS BUT NONE WERE FOR MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY, OR THREE DAYS PER WEEK. AS A RESULT, THE PATIENT WAS EITHER OVERDOSED OR UNDERDOSED, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT IN VIEW OF HIS AGE AND THE NARROW THERAPEUTIC RATIO OF DIGOXIN. THIS REPRESENTS A DEFECT IN THE DEVICE AND THE FDA SHOULD REQUIRE A MANUAL OVER RIDE OPTION IN ORDER TO INDIVIDUALIZE MEDICATION DOSES.

3519419	1	I WAS GIVEN THE ONETOUCH DIABETES GLUCOSE MONITOR BY MY DOCTOR AND I DOWNLOADED THEIR ONETOUCH DIABETES MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE V2.3 TO MY PC TO USE TO DOWNLOAD AND REPORT ON READINGS COLLECTED FROM MY METER. I NOTICED A COUPLE OF MATERIAL DEFECTS WITH THE SOFTWARE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR INCORRECT RESULTS TO BE SHARED WITH MY DOCTOR. I SHARED THIS WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE STARTING ON (B)(6) 2013. THE SOFTWARE REQUIRES THAT YOU TELL IT TIME SLOTS BEFORE AND AFTER MEAL TIMES. THIS THEN IS USED TO SLOT ANY READINGS THAT ARE DOWNLOADED FROM THE ONETOUCH DEVICE INTO THOSE FIXED SLOTS. IF YOU TRAVEL (MULTIPLE TIME ZONES) OR EAT MEALS OUTSIDE OF THOSE SLOTS, YOUR READINGS ARE INCORRECTLY SLOTTED AND YOU CANNOT EDIT/FIX THE SLOTS FOR ANY OF THE READINGS. THIS MEANS YOU COULD BE REPORTING READINGS TO YOUR DOCTOR AS BEING PRE-MEAL WHEN THEY ARE REALLY POST-MEAL AND REPORTING OTHER READINGS AS POST-MEAL WHEN THEY ARE REALLY PRE-MEAL. THE SECOND DEFECT THAT IMPACTS REPORTING ACCURATE DATA TO YOUR PHYSICIAN IS THAT THE SOFTWARE, ALTHOUGH IT CLAIMS TO SUPPORT (B)(4) FILE FORMAT DATA EXPORT AND EXPORT, DOESN'T WORK . AS A SUGGESTED "WORK AROUND" THEY SUGGESTED EXPORTING THE DATA TO A COMMA SEPARATED FILE, EDITING THE DATA, AND RE-IMPORTING IT. THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES WITH THIS METHOD INCLUDING A SECOND SOFTWARE DEFECT. FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU SIMPLY EXPORT TO (B)(6), OPEN IN (B)(6), SAVE BACK AS (B)(6) WITH NO CHANGES TO THE DATA, AND TRY TO RE-IMPORT THE SOFTWARE CLAIMS THAT THE FILE IS NOT SUPPORTED (B)(6) FORMAT. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT EVEN IF YOU COULD EDIT AND RE-IMPORT THE FILE, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 7 MEAN IN ONE OF THE COLUMNS TO MANUALLY UPDATE THE MEAL SLOTS. THE THIRD ISSUE IS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY FOR OVER 25 YEARS AND IF I CANNOT WORK AROUND THIS SOFTWARE ISSUE, HOW WOULD ANYBODY EXPECT SOMEBODY LIKE MY MOM BEING ABLE TO? BOTH ISSUES WERE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THEM AND PASSED ON THEIR DATA MANAGEMENT TEAM ON (B)(6) 2013. THAT WAS MY LAST CONTACT FROM ONETOUCH. I SWITCHED TO THE BAYER CONTOUR NEXT USB DEVICE (A COMPETITOR'S PRODUCT) AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY. WITH EVERY READING I CAN SIMPLY TELL IT IF IT IS A FASTING, BEFORE MEAL OR AFTER MEAL READING AS I TAKE MY READINGS. THEIR PC SOFTWARE IS ALSO OF MUCH HIGHER QUALITY AS WELL. SINCE REPORTING THESE DEFECTS IN THE ONETOUCH SOFTWARE THAT WOULD RESULT IN INCORRECT DATA BEING SHARED WITH MY DOCTOR, I HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED BY (B)(6) WILL NO LONGER COVER BAYER GLUCOSE TEST STRIPS AND WILL ONLY COVER ONETOUCH STRIPS. I REFUSE TO GO BACK TO A PRODUCT WHOSE ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE HAS MATERIAL DEFECTS THAT LEADS TO INACCURATE DATA BEING SHARED AND WILL THUS PAY FOR MY BAYER TEST STRIPS OUT OF POCKET IN 2014.

NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED. >< UPON RECEIPT OF THE LINE CORD AT THE FACTORY, (B)(4) ENGINEERING OBSERVED A BURN INSIDE THE WALL CONNECTOR WHERE THE WHITE CONNECTOR MEETS THE WALL PRONG OR BLADE. THE LINE CORD WAS RETURNED TO THE VENDOR, ELECTRI-CORD, WITH A REQUEST FOR CORRECTIVE/PREVENTIVE ACTION (B)(4). ELECTRI-CORD RESPONDED: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: THE MFG DATE CODE OF THE CORD WAS 0519 (10TH WEEK OF 2005), WEEK OF FEB 5, 2005. THE MOLDED PLUG WAS ECM CAT. MC-10H WITH TALLER BLADES AND GROUND PIN. THE LINE BLADES BROKE INSIDE THE MOLDED PLUG FROM FORCES THAT WERE SUFFICIENT TO BREAK THE LINE BLADES OF THE PLUG. IT IS UNK THE SOURCE OF THESE FORCES OR MIS-USE THAT CAUSED THE BROKEN BLADES. THE BROKEN BLADES CAUSED ARCING TO OCCUR, THUS THE VISUAL SPARKING. CONTAINMENT PLAN: THERE ARE NONE OF THESE PARTS WITH TALLER BLADES/GROUND PINS IN STOCK AT ECM. CORRECTION ACTION: ELECTRI-CORD MFG. HAS DISCONTINUED THE USE OF THE CRIMPED STYLE TALLER BLADE THAT WAS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE RETURNED CORD IN ALL OF THEIR MOLDED PLUGS. THESE HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY SOLDER TYPE BLADES/GROUND PINS THAT ARE MORE RESISTANT TO BREAKAGE. THE DISCONTINUATION OF THE USE OF THE TALLER BLADES/GROUND PIN IN THEIR CORDS WAS EFFECTIVE IN MID AUGUST, 2009. ALL PRODUCTION NOW USES ALTERNATE STYLE BLADES WHICH ARE MORE RESISTANT TO MIS-USE. ELECTRI-CORD REPORTS A 0.0012% FAILURE RATE FOR THESE CORDS; THEREFORE, NO ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTION IS PLANNED BY (B)(4) AT THIS TIME. REGARDING THIS PARTICULAR CUSTOMER, WE ARE REPLACING THEIR DAMAGED LINECORD. WE SUGGESTED THAT THEY INSPECT THEIR LINECORDS, AND WE WILL REPLACE ANY DAMAGED LINECORDS THAT THEY HAVE.

2725157	1	WE HAD REPLACED THIS ANESTHESIA DELIVERY UNIT (ADU) TWO DAYS BEFORE THIS EVENT. WE DID OUR STANDARD MACHINE CHECKOUT IN THE MORNING AND EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT SATISFACTORY. WE BROUGHT OUT OPEN HEART PATIENT TO OR, ATTACHED OUR MONITORS, AND DID OUR INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA. AFTER THE PATIENT WAS INTUBATED WE ATTACHED HIM TO OUR VENTILATOR AND NOTICED THAT WE DID NOT HAVE ANY END TIDAL CO2, TIDAL VOLUMES, OR ANESTHETIC DELIVERY AGENT SHOWING UP ON OUR MONITOR. THIS OF COURSE CAN HAPPEN FOR OTHER REASONS. WE AUSCULTATED THE PATIENTS LUNGS AND KNEW THAT THE PATIENT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY INTUBATED AS WE HAD USED THE GLIDESCOPE (SO WE HAD VISUALIZED THE ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE PASSING THRU THE VOCAL CORDS ON THE SCREEN ATTACHED TO THE GLIDESCOPE). PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PATIENT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT INTUBATION. WE DID QUICKLY GET OUR PORTABLE ETCO2 MONITOR TO MONITOR ETCO2. AFTER WE DETERMINED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SAFE, WE TRIED TO REPLACE THE GAS MODULE (THAT GIVES US ALL OF THIS INFORMATION) AND WE IMMEDIATELY CALLED BIOMED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE MACHINE. IN THE MEANTIME WE HAD TO TELL OUR OPEN HEART SURGEON THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DELAY THE START OF THE CASE UNTIL WE EITHER GOT THE CURRENT MACHINE OPERATING CORRECTLY OR WE BROUGHT IN A NEW MACHINE. THANKFULLY I HAD ANOTHER CRNA, MDA, AND ANESTHESIA TECHNICIAN TO HELP ME GET A NEW ANESTHESIA MACHINE INTO THE ROOM. HAD THIS BEEN ON A WEEKEND OR OFF SHIFT WHEN WE HAVE LIMITED STAFFING THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM TO THE PATIENT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HIGHER. THIS WAS NOT EASY TO TRANSFER MACHINES WHILE THE PATIENT WAS ASLEEP AND REQUIRED EXTENSIVE MONITORING. WE GOT A NEW ADU INTO THE OPERATING ROOM AFTER THE PATIENT WAS HOOKED UP TO AN AUXILIARY MONITOR AND WAS ATTACHED TO AN AMBU BAG AND 100% OXYGEN AND WAS HAND VENTILATED UNTIL WE GOT THE NEW MACHINE INTO THE OR. THE MALFUNCTIONINGMACHINE WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN TO BE CHECKED OUT BY BIOMED. SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEW MACHINE THAT THEY BROUGHT IN TO REPLACE THE MALFUNCTIONING MACHINE ALSO HAD A CIRCUIT BOARD THAT ENDED UP NEEDING TO BE REPLACED AFTER OUR CASE WAS DONE. IN THE OPEN HEART ROOM WE HAVE MULTIPLE TV MONITORS THAT SHOW OUR VITAL SIGNS SO THAT THE PERFUSION TEAM, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, AND SURGEONS CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE PATIENTS VITAL SIGNS AT ANY SECOND BASED ON HOW THEY ARE MANIPULATING THE HEART. THE 2ND MACHINE WOULD NOT DISPLAY THE VITAL SIGNS ONTO THE MONITORS. BIOMED WAS ABLE TO CONFIGURE SOMETHING TEMPORARILY TO GET US THRU THE CASE AND THEN REPLACED THE CIRCUIT BOARD AFTER THE CASE WAS OVER. BIOMED ASSESSMENT: THE MONITOR (DATEX OHMEDA ADU) WAS INTERMITTENTLY DISPLAYING" GAS MEASUREMENT REMOVED" WHICH PREVENTED ANY ETCO2 MEASUREMENTS FROM BEING DISPLAYED ON THE ADU. BIOMED REPLACED THE GAS MODULE DURING THE PROCEDURE BUT IT DID NOT REMEDIATE THE PROBLEM. THE ADU WAS REMOVED FOR SERVICE AND THE ERROR LOGS WERE CHECKED WHICH DID NOT INDICATE ANY SPECIFIC ERROR CODES THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF PROBLEM. AFTER THE MACHINE WAS POWERED OFF AND BROUGHT IN TO BIOMED THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. BIOMED CONTACTED GE TECH SUPPORT AND FOLLOWED AND PERFORMED ALL THE RECOMMENDED TESTING PROCEDURES AND SELF DIAGNOSTICS. THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED. GE TECH SUPPORT THINKS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT RESETTING THE POWER TO THE MACHINE BY TURNING THE MONITOR OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN CLEARED THE PROBLEM AND WAS A TEMPORARY SOFTWARE GLITCH. THE 2ND ADU THAT WAS BROUGHT IN AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE MACHINE NOTED ABOVE WAS MONITORING THE PATIENT AND DELIVERING ANESTHESIA PROPERLY ITSELF BUT IT WAS NOT SENDING DATA AND WAVEFORMS TO THE SLAVE DISPLAYS IN THE ROOM WHICH ARE ALSO VIEWED BY THE SURGEON AND PERFUSIONIST. THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY A FAULTY OUTPUT DISPLAY BOARD (BDISP) WHICH WAS REPLACED AFTER THE PROCEDURE AND RESOLVED THE PROBLEM WITH THE MACHINE. NO HARM TO PATIENT.

1656460	1	THE MEDICATION REVIEW SCREEN OF THE SUBJECT DEVICE DOES NOT SPECIFY THE EXACT DOSE IN MILLIGRAMS OF COMBINATION MEDICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, NARCOTICS ARE COMBINED WITH TYLENOL IN AT LEAST TWO STRENGTHS. LIQUID NARCOTIC TYLENOL-OXYCODONE COMBINATION IS REPORTED IN ML, NOT MG. THE EXACT DOSE OF TYLENOL IS NOT SPECIFIED AND REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMBINATION MEDICATION DOSE IN THE VOLUME SPECIFIED. CERTAIN FIELDS OF THE GRID DO NOT SPECIFY THE VOLUME, BUT RATHER STATE 'DATE/TIME' REQUIRING ANOTHER CLICK OR POP UP SCREEN. THE IMMEDIATE KNOWLEDGE OF TYLENOL DOSAGE IN MG IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING EXCESSIVE DOSES. IN THE SUBJECT, 10 ML OF ACETAMINOPHEN-OXYCODONE IS INDICATED AS HAVING BEEN GIVEN 3 TIMES OVER 4 HOURS. THAT MEANS THAT 1950 MG OF TYLENOL WAS ADMINISTERED IN 4 HOURS WHILE THE PATIENT WAS IN A STATE OF STARVATION AND RECEIVING OTHER MEDICATION THAT INCREASE THE EFFECTS OF TYLENOL. THIS DOSE WOULD EQUATE TO 11,700 MG OF TYLENOL OVER 24 HOURS, NEARLY 3 TIMES THE MAXIMUM DAILY DOSE IN OTHERWISE HEALTH PEOPLE. IN THE ENSUING DAYS, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, PRESUMABLY ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS, AND DIED. IN THE ABSENCE OF OTHER ETIOLOGY, THE EXCESS TYLENOL WAS THE CULPRIT. THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED AS ETIOLOGY ANTE-MORTEM. THE COUNTERINTUITIVE SCREEN IMPAIRED THE PROFESSIONALS. THE PHARMACIST DID NOT RECOGNIZE AND STOP THE MEDICATION, THE NURSES ADMINISTERED IT, AND THE EXCESSIVE DOSE, CLINICALLY MEANINGLESSLY LISTED AS A VOLUME OF 10 ML -GIVEN 3 TIMES IN 4 HOURS- OF ACETAMINOPHEN-OXYCODONE, WAS MISSED BY THE PHYSICIANS. ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN ASCRIBED TO 'USER ERROR' BY VENDORS. THE DEVICE OFFERS A POTENT PROPENSITY TO LIFE ENDANGERING OVERSIGHTS. THERE ARE OTHER SCREENS ON THIS DEVICE WHICH PRESENT INFORMATION THAT INTERFERE WITH CLINICALLY USEFUL VISUALIZATION OF DATA. THE DATA DOES NOT FLOW TO THE PROFESSIONALS. IT IS NOT REPRESENTED IN A MEANINGFULLY USEFUL MANNER. THE PROFESSIONALS NEED TO HUNT FOR IT. AS SUCH, THE USER UNFRIENDLY SCREENS IMPAIR SAFE MEDICAL CARE CONSISTENT WITH THE IMPEDIMENT TO EXPEDIENT PROFESSIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THE DOSE OF MEDICATION AND HOW MUCH WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE PATIENT. THIS SENTINEL CASE OF DEATH IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO USER UNFRIENDLY SCREENS ON THIS DEVICE.

(B)(4).><ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED FROM THE BWI FIELD REPRESENTATIVE ON THE EVENT. AFTER A PLANNED CARDIOVERSION, THE MAP AND CATHETER POSITION WERE NOT ALIGNED. THE REASON FOR THE CARDIOVERSION WAS A VT WHICH COULD NOT BE OVER STIMULATED. THE ACL FUNCTION WAS IN USE DURING THE CASE. THE NAVISTAR CATHETER AND THE IBI DECAPOLAR ACL CATHETER MOVED RELATIVE TO THE MAP. BOTH THE ACL CATHETER AND THE MAGNETIC CATHETER SHIFTED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND IT WAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF SHIFT. THE IBI DECAPOLAR WAS CONNECTED TO THE REF/DECA IN THE PATIENT INTERFACE UNIT. THE REFERENCE PATCH DID NOT MOVE OR GET LOOSE BEFORE THE MAP SHIFT. THE CASE WAS COMPLETED CONVENTIONALLY. EVALUATION SUMMARY. (B)(4). IT WAS REPORTED DURING AN IDIOPATHIC VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA PROCEDURE THERE WAS A MAP SHIFT OF 38MM WITHOUT ANY ERROR OR ALERT. THE CASE WAS COMPLETED AND THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY REPORTED. THE ISSUE WAS NOT DUPLICATED; HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE BWI FIELD REPRESENTATIVE, THE MAP SHIFT OCCURRED AFTER CARDIOVERSION. MAP SHIFTS AFTER CARDIOVERSION OCCURS BECAUSE THE PATIENT'S HEART CAN PHYSICALLY MOVE WITH RESPECT TO THE INITIAL PATCH REFERENCE POSITIONS. CARTO IS NOT INTENDED TO FIX SUCH RELATIVE MOTION. IFU STATES: "IN RARE CASES, THE RELATIVE POSITION BETWEEN THE PATCHES REMAINS THE SAME BUT THE POSITION OF THE HEART RELATIVE TO THE BACK PATCHES HAS CHANGED (FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER REPOSITIONING THE PATIENT'S HEAD ON A PILLOW OR MOVING THE PATIENT'S ARM WITHOUT CHANGING THE PATIENT'S POSITION ON THE MATTRESS, OR AFTER THE PATIENT IS CARDIOVERTED). DUE TO SUCH INTERNAL ANATOMIC DISPLACEMENTS, THERE MIGHT BE MISALIGNMENT OF THE MAP TO THE HEART LOCATION, "THE SYSTEM WILL NOT GIVE A WARNING AND AN INCORRECT MAP (MAP SHIFT) MIGHT BE GENERATED. "WHEN IN DOUBT, CLOSE THE CURRENT MAP AND BEGIN A NEW ONE. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) REVIEW WAS PERFORMED. NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED IN MANUFACTURING OR SERVICE.

885663	0	THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. FOUR CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT CAN LEAD TO A STOP OF THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) WHEN THE SAMPLE IS PRESENTED TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE FOR ASPIRATION: REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM A ROUTINE BAY WHILE THE ACCESS INDICATOR IS AMBER; - OPENING AN RSH COVER WHILE THE RSH IS IN THE RUNNING STATE; - USER REQUESTING STOP EITHER ON THE RSH KEYPAD OR FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN ON THE SYSTEM CONTROL CENTER; - A NON-RECOVERABLE HARDWARE FAILURE OF AN RSH MECHANISM. INVESTIGATION OF THE ISSUE DISCOVERED A TIMING-DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY-REMOVAL DOES NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CLINICAL CHEMISTRY MODULE. THIS CONDITION CAUSES THE MODULE TO RECEIVE AN ERRONEOUS SAMPLE ARRIVAL FOR TESTS/SAMPLES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DELETED WHEN THE RSH NOTIFIED THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE OF THE TRAY REMOVAL ERROR CONDITION. AFTER A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY THE MODULE SENDS AN EQUALLY ERRONEOUS SAMPLE FREE MESSAGE THAT CAUSES THE RSH TO INDEX THE CARRIER TO THE NEXT POSITION. AT THAT POINT THE SEQUENCE OF SAMPLING IS OFF BY ONE CARRIER POSITION. THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED IN SOFTWARE VERSION 3.00 FOR THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM, BUT ALL SOFTWARE VERSIONS THAT SUPPORTED AN INTERFACE TO THE C8000 AND/OR THE C16000 AND RSH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS ISSUE (V2.00, V2.01, V2.02, V2.03, V2.10, V2.11, V2.20, V2.20 DB UPDATE, V2.60, V2.30, V3.00 AND V3.10). THE ISSUE CAN OCCUR ON THE C8000 AND C16000 SYSTEMS SINCE THE RSH AND THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE ARE COMMON TO BOTH CONFIGURATIONS. THE ISSUE WAS FOUND TO BE DUE TO A TIMING- DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY REMOVAL WOULD NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE. LABELING: THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL CONTAINS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE USE AND FUNCTION OF THE RSH IN SECTION 1. STATUS INDICATORS INDICATES THE STATUS OF SAMPLE PROCESSING AND WHEN THE OPERATOR CAN ACCESS SAMPLES. A STEADY AMBER LIGHT INDICATES THAT SAMPLES ARE PROCESSING AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED. SECTION 5: OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS; SUBSECTION: SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PROVIDES PROCEDURES FOR LOADING SAMPLES ONTO THE RSH FOR PROCESSING. THE PROCEDURE 'ACCESS A SAMPLE WITH TESTS IN PROCESS' ADVISES THE OPERATOR TO PERFORM THIS PROCEDURE TO SUSPEND A BAY ON THE RSH WHEN IMMEDIATE ACCESS IS NEEDED TO A SAMPLE THAT IS BEING PROCESSED. IMPROPER REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM THE RSH WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE ERROR CODE 0273 (REMOVAL FROM THE PRIORITY BAY) OR 0274 (REMOVAL FROM THE ROUTINE BAY). THE STOPPED STATUS FOR THE RSH IS DESCRIBED IN TABLE 1.3. CONDITIONS FOR THE RSH TO BE STOPPED INCLUDE:- THE OPERATOR HAS SELECTED F6- STOP FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN OR THE STOP KEY ON THE SAMPLE HANDLER KEYPAD;- ONE OF THE RSH COVERS WAS OPENED WHILE THE SAMPLE HANDLER WAS RUNNING;- SAMPLE HANDLER DETECTED A FATAL ERROR WHILE PROCESSING. THE OPERATOR IS ADVISED IN SECTION 7: OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TO 'KEEP ALL PROCESSING MODULE AND SAMPLE HANDLER DOORS CLOSED AND COVERS IN PLACE UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE IN A MAINTENANCE OR TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE' WHILE OPERATING THE SYSTEM. OPENING A COVER DURING OPERATION WILL RESULT IN THE GENERATION OF ERROR CODE 0709, RSH STOPPED, COVER OPENED. TROUBLESHOOTING ASSISTANCE FOR ALL ERROR CODES IS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS. >< THE CUSTOMER STATED TEST RESULTS ON THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, SAMPLE 1 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 2, SAMPLE 2 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 3, ETC. THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) GENERATED ERROR CODES 0274, TRAY IN BAY (X) WAS REMOVED BEFORE ACCESS WAS GRANTED, AND 0526, EMPTY TRAY DETECTED IN BAY (X), INDICATING THAT THE OPERATOR HAD INAPPROPRIATELY REMOVED A TRAY FROM THE RSH. CODE 0304, TRANSPORTER ERROR ALSO OCCURRED. THE RSH WENT TO STOPPED STATUS WHILE THE PROCESSING MODULE REMAINED IN RUNNING. THE OPERATOR ORDERED RERUNS FROM THE EXCEPTION SCREEN AND BEGAN TO RUN AGAIN. THE OPERATOR SUSPECTED AN ABERRANT RESULT ON A SAMPLE AND STOPPED THE RUN. REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE RESULTS WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. SAMPLE #6 HAD THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE #7. THE OPERATOR FOUND 28 CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES THAT WERE AFFECTED. THIRTEEN OF THE RESULTS HAD ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE DOCTOR, BUT NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED.

2160309	1	GENEXPERT INFINITY XPERTISE SOFTWARE, VERSION 4.1A, ALLOWS USER TO ENTER TEST ORDERS FASTER THAN THE REQUEST FOR LAB INFO SYS (LIS) ORDERS CAN BE PROCESSED. IN COMPLAINT (B)(4), A CUSTOMER (B)(6) REPORTED VISUAL OBSERVATION OF MISMATCHED PT ID AND SAMPLE RESULTS. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, CEPHEID FIELD SUPPORT DETERMINED THAT WHEN BATCH LOADING CARTRIDGES ONTO THE GENEXPERT INFINITY-48, IF INPUT DATA (PATIENT ID, SAMPLE ID, AND CARTRIDGE ID) ARE ADDED VERY QUICKLY, THE SYSTEM MAY NOT PAIR THE PT SAMPLE WITH CORRECT LIS TEST ORDER. THE INCORRECT PAIRING OF LIS ORDERED PT ID TO A SAMPLE ID CAN OCCUR IF SAMPLES ARE PROCESSED FASTER THAN LIS ORDERS ARE DOWNLOADED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SAMPLE ID #1 IS SCANNED, THE LIS ORDER DOWNLOAD STARTS, BUT THE TEST CAN BE STARTED BEFORE THE DOWNLOAD HAS COMPLETED. IF SAMPLE ID #2 IS SCANNED BEFORE THE FIRST LIS ORDER DOWNLOAD COMPLETES, THE SAMPLE ID #2 MAY BE INCORRECTLY PAIRED TO THE FIRST LIS ORDERED PT ID. THERE WAS NO RISK OF INJURY TO PT DURING THE ORIGINATING EVENT AT (B)(6) (REPORTING SITE, (B)(4)) BECAUSE THE SITE COMPARES ALL TEST RESULTS TO TEST ORDERS BY PT NAME, SAMPLE ID TEST ORDER NUMBER AND CARTRIDGE NUMBER. THE TRANSPOSITION OF DATA WAS DETECTED BEFORE PT RESULTS WERE REPORTED. THE EXACT CONFIGURATION THAT ALLOWED THE EVENT TO OCCUR WAS IDENTIFIED (INFINITY 48 SYSTEMS WITH GENEXPERT 4.1A USING HOST QUERY TEST ORDER DOWNLOAD CONFIGURATION AND BATCH LOADING). NO OTHER SITES USED THIS EXACT CONFIGURATION AND THEREFORE, COULD NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE MALFUNCTION THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED IN A DISCREPANT PT RESULT REPORT. ALL UNITED STATES CONSIGNEES WERE CONTACTED BY PHONE 04/01/2011. ALL UNITED STATES CONSIGNEES RECEIVED A COPY OF EMAIL 04/01/2011. ALL XUS CUSTOMERS WERE NOTIFIED BY 04/08/2011. EACH CONSIGNEE WERE SENT A HARD COPY CORRECTIVE ACTION NOTIFICATION BY (B)(4) BY 04/27/2011. SUMMARY OF EVAL: EVAL OF THE (B)(6) DISCREPANT SPECIMEN RESULTS INCLUDED: REVIEW OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS - NONE FOUND. REVIEW OF UNRESOLVED ANOMALY LIST FOR SIMILAR ISSUE - NONE FOUND. TRACING CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS OF THE DATA HAND-OFF POINTS FROM LIS TO INFINITY FOR TEST ORDER DOWNLOADS, RUNNING CARTRIDGE, AND UPLOAD OF TEST RESULTS FROM INFINITY TO LIS. WALKTHROUGH OF DATABASE RECORDS AND THEIR LINKAGES. COOL WALKTHROUGHS FOR BOTH LIS TEST ORDER DOWNLOAD PATH AND PATH FOR TEST RESULT UPLOAD TO LIS. ATTEMPTS TO REPRODUCE THE EVENTS BY RUNNING (B)(6) SPECIFIC LIS CONFIGURATION USING BATCH LOADING OF CARTRIDGES. BY EVALUATING THE DATA HAND-OFF POINTS AND SEEING HOW THE DATABASE RECORDS WERE LINKING THE DATA WITHIN THE DATABASE, THE SCENARIO WAS ABLE TO BE REPRODUCED USING THE SPECIFIC LIS CONFIGURATION. THE COMBINATION OF USING HOST QUERY LIS CONFIGURATION WHERE THE SCANNING OF THE SAMPLE ID REQUESTS INFO FROM THE LIS AND THE RAPID LOADING OF CARTRIDGES BEFORE THE LIS TEST ORDER HAD DOWNLOADED WERE DETERMINED TO BE THE ROOT CAUSE. CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN WITH CUSTOMERS AND PREVENTIVE ACTION WILL INCLUDE NEW SOFTWARE RELEASE. NO PTS WERE MISDIAGNOSED DUE TO THIS MALFUNCTION. ONLY ONE CONSIGNEE SITE WAS CONFIGURED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CAUSE THE MALFUNCTION. BECAUSE INFINITY RESULTS WERE ALWAYS COMPARED TO LIS TEST RESULTS MANUALLY, NO PT DATA WERE AFFECTED AND THE SITE DID NOT REPORT ANY DISCREPANT RESULTS.

6137375	0	investigation of this complaint found that a use error occurred at 16:40pm on (b)(6) 2016, when a user affirmed in the instrument software that the reagent concentration in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) was to be set to default value of 100%. the actual ethanol concentration in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) remained unchanged at 80.2%, because bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) had not been removed from the instrument for sufficient time to replace the reagent. as the instrument software uses reagent concentration to select reagent stations when a protocol is scheduled; the reagent station with the lowest (in-threshold) concentration of a reagent group or type is selected for the first step using that reagent group or type; and reagent stations of increasing concentration are used for the succeeding processing steps of the reagent group or type. reagent with the highest concentration is always used for the final processing step of a reagent group or type before changing to another reagent group or type. as a consequence, bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) was used for the final dehydration step of both the skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016. the minimum final reagent concentration required for ethanol is 98%. the consequences of using ethanol at a concentration less than the minimum required for the final dehydration step in a protocol is re-introduction of water into the tissue which cannot be displaced in subsequent processing steps; and contamination of reagents used in the subsequent processing steps  ultimately resulting in sub-optimal tissue processing. the tissue samples from the "skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016 would have been further adversely impacted by the reported use of the cleaning protocol as the first step in the regimen used to re-process these samples. use of the cleaning protocol to re-process samples is a use error as detailed in section 3.2 of the (b)(4) peloris/peloris ll user manual  which contains the following specific warning: "do not use cleaning protocols for reprocessing as the dry step will damage tissue." the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported from both the "bx and large runs" protocols executed on (b)(6) 2016 was a use error. specifically  a user failed to complete manual replacement of the reagent in bottle 8 (absolute ethanol) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions detailed in the (b)(4) peloris/peloris ll user manual. the (b)(4) peloris/peloris ll user manual contains the following specific warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss." the tissue samples would have been further adversely impacted by the reported use of the cleaning protocol as the first step in the regimen used for re-processing of the affected samples. use of the cleaning protocol to re-process samples is also a use error as detailed in section 3.2 of the (b)(4) peloris/peloris ll user manual  which contains the following specific warning: "do not use cleaning protocols for reprocessing as the dry step will damage tissue." the root cause of the sub-optimal processing reported from a processing run(s) executed on both (b)(6) 2016 could not be determined from the information available.><(b)(4) received a complaint that tissue from a protocol run in retort b on the evening of (b)(6) 2016 was "not processing" and "pathologist says alcohol in xylene." the complainant also advised that the reagent in bottles 3 6  7 and 8 had been changed; "xylenes look good" and "waxes were not checked." on (b)(6) 2016  a (b)(4) field support specialist (fss) attended the laboratory in order to obtain further details of the circumstances involved in the complaint and to provide applications support. the complainant advised the fss that: "the first problem with processing occurred on (b)(6) 2016 on both the bx and large runs. the tissue came off both of these tissue runs seemed raw and not processed." the complainant also advised that the affected tissue samples from these protocols had been re-processed by "first running tissue through the cleaning cycle and then re-running the tissue program." the complainant reported that the following samples from the "skin/gi bxs" protocol started in retort a at 16:46pm on (b)(6) 2016 and/or the "routine 6hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:47pm on (b)(6) 2016 were undiagnosable: liver biopsy samples derived from three (3) male patients and one (1) female patient and one (1) prostate biopsy sample. the fss also documented that re-biopsy had been recommended for the patients for whom tissue was undiagnosable. the complainant also reported that intermittent processing issues  which were described by the pathologists as an artefact caused by "alcohol in the xylene on the tissue processor"  had been specifically reported by the pathologists on both (b)(6) 2016. on 10 november 2016  the fss confirmed that no further information would be provided regarding the five (5) patients for whom re-biopsy was recommended. as a consequence  neither an identifier nor the age/date of birth is available for the five (5) patients for whom re-biopsy was recommended. refer to mfr. report #8020030-2016-00083;

6197460	0	bottle 7 (ethanol) was not in contact with the corresponding sensor for 30 seconds from 08:43am on (b)(6) 2016, which is not sufficient time to replace the reagent; and the properties of reagent station were reset. although the user affirmed in the instrument software that the reagent concentration in bottle 7 (ethanol) was to be set to 100% at 08:44am on (b)(6), the actual concentration of reagent in bottle 7 (ethanol) remained unchanged at 56.9% because the bottle had not been removed from the instrument for sufficient time to replace the reagent. as the instrument software uses reagent concentration to select reagent stations when a protocol is scheduled, the reagent station with the lowest (in-threshold) concentration of a reagent group or type is selected for the first step using that reagent group or type; and reagent stations of increasing concentration are used for the succeeding processing steps of the reagent group or type. reagent with the highest concentration is always used for the final processing step of a reagent group or type before changing to another reagent group or type. as a consequence, bottle 7 (ethanol) was used for the final dehydration step of the routine 8hr" protocols started in retort b at 14:09pm on (b)(6) 2016 and in retort a at 02:01am on (b)(6) 2016. the minimum final reagent concentration required for ethanol is 98%. the consequences of using reagent at a concentration less than the minimum required for the final dehydration/clearing step in a protocol is re-introduction of water into the tissue which cannot be displaced in subsequent processing steps; and contamination of reagents used in the subsequent processing steps  ultimately resulting in sub-optimal tissue processing. investigation of this complaint found that the instrument operated within specification during execution of the routine 8hr" protocols started in retort b at 14:09pm on (b)(6) 2016 and in retort a at 02:01am on (b)(6) 2016. the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported was a use error  which occurred at 08:44am on (b)(6) 2016. specifically  a user failed to complete manual replacement of the reagent in bottle 7 (ethanol) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions detailed in the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual  which contains the following specific warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss."><leica biosystems received a complaint that tissue was "very mushy" following processing. the complainant advised that the tissue samples exhibiting sub-optimal processing had been re-processed on another tissue processor located in the laboratory; a validation processing run(s) had been completed; all tissue samples exhibiting sub-optimal processing were diagnosable and the instrument had been used by the laboratory on both (b)(6) 2016 without reported incident."

6100197	0	a customer in the united states notified biom?rieux of a complaint regarding a warning message on the myla? server indicated as an error code 6 instrument change involving four (4) bact/alert? sn culture bottles for four (4) patients. the bottles were loaded into the system on (b)(6) 2016. the customer described their system configuration as including bact/alert? 3d (version: b.40 rel 4) and myla? (version: 3.3.2-5). the customer reported that they did not relocate any bottles and stated they performed gram stain and subculture on two (2) of the four (4) bottles. the customer was directed to gram stain and subculture all four (4) bottles. the customer indicated one bottle as being false positive flagged". the customer did not report adverse events or negative patient impact associated with this issue. a biom?rieux investigation was performed. as the myla? server performed as intended by preventing an update to the database for this patient record  and instructed the customer regarding culture bottle handling  there was no myla? malfunction. biom?rieux opened an investigation to determine root cause of the trigger of the myla? alarm. the bact/alert? bottle label supplier (b)(4) was notified that biom?rieux had received a complaint for a duplicate bottle id number. (b)(4) indicated the numbers were generated by a biomerieux-supplied software. the numbers are 100% scanned by (b)(4) for no read  no scan  poor quality  and to ensure there are no duplicated bottle id numbers within the set. as part of the (b)(4) investigation  the numbers reported as duplicate were compared to a database of bottle id numbers (b)(4) had generated prior to biom?rieux supplying the bottle id numbers. the reported bottle id numbers were confirmed to have been previously issued. (b)(4) concluded the root cause was that biom?rieux had supplied bottle id numbers identical to numbers (b)(4) had historically generated. a "retain label analysis" by biom?rieux confirmed (b)(4) conclusion on september 12  2016. further analysis of equipment configurations concluded "bact/alert? connected to observa?" or "bact/alert? connected to bact/view" could allow the result for a previous patient to be assigned to a new patient. however  investigation determined it is not likely that bact/alert? connected to observa? will impact results since the workflow delays linking the culture bottle to the patient record. in each case  the correct result will be assigned to the new patient record upon completion of the bottle test. in addition  clinical environment mitigations decrease the likelihood of an erroneous result going unnoticed. ?? clsi guidance m47-a  principles and procedures for blood cultures  regarding the required number of blood culture bottles indicates "a single culture bottle is clearly inadequate ..... multiple sets would help a clinician to distinguish .... ." as this guidance is expected to be followed by laboratories  other bottles within the set may be positive as well and it is unlikely that a doctor would stop empirical therapy because of one negative blood culture bottle result reported from the lis. the expected preliminary result would most likely be negative-to-date rather than the negative that is potentially reported due to this issue. (b)(6) also states "it can be concluded from available data that two to four blood cultures are necessary to optimize detection of bacteremia and fungemia." ?? (b)(6) 1c  blood culture iv  states that prior to leaving the patient's bedside the following details are to be included on culture bottle label(s): two unique identifiers (e.g. name  birthdate  social security number  etc.). collector's name  employee number  and/or employee code. collection site (e.g. vein  arm  leg  etc.). the amount of blood collected  if different from the culture bottle requirements). ?? if the bottle is called positive  the technologist will unload it to subculture and gram stain. proper bottle labeling by the user makes it likely that the negative result initially reported would be detected. additionally  if the bottle is true positive the physician is immediately notified and the result is updated in the database management system (i.e. observa?) or laboratory information system (lis). therefore  it is highly likely that the false initial report would be detected and the positive result will be reported for the correct patient. health hazard assessment (hha) by medical doctor indicated the issue is not expected to have a negative impact on patient health due to both product mitigations  as well as mitigations that occur in the context of the clinical environment. even though there is no necessary corrective action needed in the field  this event is being reported under 21 cfr 803  medical device reporting as a reportable malfunction.><device not returned to manufacturer."

2099346	0	WHILE REPLACING THE CELL-DYN WASTE CONTAINER, THE CUSTOMER IDENTIFIED A BROKEN CABLE OF THE WASTE SENSOR. THE WASTE SENSOR WAS THEN REPLACED IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. NO IMPACT TO PATIENT RESULTS, PATIENT MANAGEMENT OR USER SAFETY WAS REPORTED. (B)(4). AN EXPANDED INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THIS ISSUE. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE RETURNED PARTS FROM THE FIELD SHOWED THAT THE PART HAS BEEN IN USE GREATER THAN TWO YEARS. ALTHOUGH, THE WASTE OUTLET TUBE ASSEMBLY MEETS THE RELIABILITY REQUIREMENT, THIS PART WILL WEAR OUT AND THERE EXISTS A POTENTIAL FOR THE WASTE CONTAINER TO OVERFLOW WITH LIQUID WASTE WHEN THE WASTE SENSOR FAILS AT THE END OF ITS LIFE CYCLE. THEREFORE; THE PART WILL NEED PERIODIC REPLACEMENT AS IT IS IN CONTACT WITH BIOHAZARD MATERIAL AND CUSTOMER USAGE/HANDLING. THE PART CAN BE USED ON MULTIPLE CELL-DYN INSTRUMENT MODELS. A REVIEW OF THE CELL-DYN SYSTEM OPERATORS MANUALS SHOWED ADEQUATE COVERAGE OF BIOHAZARD EXPOSURE AND WASTE OVERFLOW AS WELL AS TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION FOR POTENTIAL CAUSES. ABBOTT RECOMMENDED A REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE FOR THE WASTE LINE ASSEMBLY FOR THE CELL-DYN SYSTEMS. THE WASTE BOTTLE CABLE IS A SUBCOMPONENT OF THE WASTE LINE ASSEMBLY, CHANGING THE WASTE LINE ASSEMBLY WILL RESULT IN CHANGING THE WASTE BOTTLE CABLE. AS PART OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTION, A PRODUCT CORRECTION LETTER, (B)(4), WAS ISSUED TO ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. IN THIS COMMUNICATION, ABBOTT RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE PART EVERY SIX MONTHS. AN UPDATE TO THE PRODUCT LABELING WILL BE ADDED AS WELL WITH REGARDS TO THIS RECOMMENDATION. A TAG THAT CAN BE AFFIXED TO THESE ITEMS WAS SENT WITH THE CUSTOMER LETTER. THIS TAG INCLUDES FIELDS TO RECORD INSTALLATION AND REPLACEMENT DATES. THE TAGS WILL ALSO BE INTRODUCED INTO REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLIES.

6143391	0	with further investigation, it was determined the root cause was due to user error. when the barcode is read at the bt-40 the laboratory information system (lis) provides the test order and patient demographics for the sample. the operator did not follow proper sample processing instructions and placed a rack at an analyzer to be processed without allowing the barcode to be read by the barcode terminal first. the xn software has been improved to change the communication between the bt-40 and xn analyzer, so when the xn-10 reads an unexpected barcode number for a sample that was not read by the bt-40, it will not associate any patient demographic information to the sample. there is a software version update to mitigate operator errors due to moving tubes incorrectly or placing racks at the analyzer that have not been read by the bt-40. it was determined there is minimal risk because results sent to the lis are accurate for the barcodes that are read at the analyzer even though the display on the xn and any printouts would show incorrect demographics.? xn-9000 users were provided a product notification reminding them that sample tubes should not be moved, replaced or swapped from their position after leaving the bt-40.><a correction to the xn-10 software was developed to enhance communication between the bt-40 and xn analyzer, so when the xn-10 reads an unexpected barcode number for a sample that was not read by the bt-40, it will not associate any patient demographic information to the sample. a field corrective action will be performed to implement the software.><on (b)(6) 2016 at 07:18 am, the xn-10 with bar code terminal (bt-40) in an xn-9000 configuration identified quality control (qc) level 1, 2 and 3 results with the patient demographics from 3 different patients. the operator stated they were processing patient samples and qc at the same time. data demonstrates the barcode terminal (bt-40) read the patient sample barcodes in the rack (b)(4) at 07:13. when the barcode is read at the bt-40 the lab information system (lis) provides the test order and patient demographics for the sample. the operator placed the qc rack at the analyzer sampler area, bypassing the bt-40, so qc barcodes were not read first by the bt-40 before analysis. the qc rack proceeded to the xn-10 sampling area, and the bar code for each sample is read. the xn-10 read the bar code of the first qc sample in the qc rack at 07:16. the barcode numbers for the qc were read accurately; however, the qc results were assigned the patient demographics that belonged to three patients samples that were read in rack (b)(4) by the bt-40. the operator incorrectly processed the qc samples, but the xn-10 incorrectly applied demographics that did not belong to the qc barcode that was read when the qc sample was analyzed. this event occurred with qc samples and no harm to patients were incurred; however, if this issue were to reoccur the xn-10 could apply incorrect patient demographics to patient samples on the xn analyzer display. the results sent to the lis are accurate for the barcodes that are read.

2382510	1	(B)(6) MEDICATION ERRORS REPORTING PROGRAM: OUR MED/SURG WARD UTILIZES REMOTE TELEMETRY MONITORING DEVICES TO MONITOR CONTINUOUS EKG AND/OR OXIMETRY. IT IS A BOX WITH ELECTRODES ON THE PT, THAT SUBMITS INFO WIRELESSLY ON ANOTHER FLOOR OF THE HOSPITAL, WHERE IT IS MONITORED BY A TECHNICIAN. AT LEAST ONCE A SHIFT, WE RECEIVE A PRINT OUT OF THE EKG THAT HAS BEEN READ TO INFORM US OF THE RHYTHM. IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE ECG OR HEART RATE, THAT UNIT CALLS OUR UNIT, AND THE NURSE ON OUR WARD IS NOTIFIED BY THE NURSE'S STATION OF THE CHANGE. WHILE WE DO HAVE A SMALL MONITORING SCREEN ON OUR WARD WITH THE ECG READINGS, NO ONE IS THERE TO MONITOR IT, AND NURSES ON OUR FLOOR ARE LIMITED IN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE IN TERMS OF WHICH CARDIAC MEDS WE CAN GIVE IV. IF A PT CONDITION CHANGES THAT REQUIRES INCREASED MONITORING AND/OR THAT THEY RECEIVE THESE DRUGS, A UNIT TRANSFER IS REQUIRED. A NURSE WAS ASSUMING CARE OF A PT XYZ BEING MONITORED ON ONE OF THESE REMOTE TELEMETRY BOXES. DURING THE USUAL BEGINNING OF SHIFT ASSESSMENT, THE NURSE LOOKED AT THE BOX, ENSURED ALL OF THE ELECTRODES WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACE, THE BOX WAS ON, AND HAD BATTERIES. IN RETROSPECT, THIS NURSE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS ASSESSMENT ONE STEP FURTHER, AND CHECKED THE TELE BOX NUMBER TO THE MONITOR AT THE NURSES STATION. THE CHARGE NURSE, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, WAS DOING HER USUAL CHECK OF THE TELEMETRY LOG, AND NOTICED THAT PT XYZ'S NAME WAS NOT ON THE MONITOR AT THE NURSE'S STATION. BY CHECKING THE BOX NUMBER, NOT THE PT NAME, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE NAME ON THE SCREEN FOR THAT PARTICULAR BOX WAS FOR SOMEONE ELSE ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FLOOR, AND NOT PT XYZ AFTER ALL. FROM WHAT I COULD BEST GATHER, ON THE PREVIOUS SHIFT, OUR UNIT WAS GIVEN AN ADMISSION THAT HAD REMOTE TELEMETRY ORDERED. THE TRANSFERRING NURSE FAILED TO REPORT THAT TELEMETRY WAS REQUIRED ON THE RECEIVING UNIT. AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME, ALL OF THE TELEMETRY BOXES IN THE ENTIRE HOSP WERE IN USE. THE NURSING SUPERVISOR WAS NOTIFIED, WHO THEN WENT SEARCHING FOR A BOX. HE OR SHE BROUGHT A BOX FROM ANOTHER FLOOR. APPARENTLY, THE BOX WAS FROM A PT 123 WHO WAS IN SURGERY, AND THE BOX WAS LEFT AT THE BEDSIDE, WAITING FOR PT 123'S RETURN. WHEN THE SUPERVISOR PICKED UP THE BOX, SHE DIDN'T CALL THE MONITORING UNIT TO INFORM THEM OF THE PT SWITCH, THAT A NEW PT WAS GOING TO BE MONITORED. THE BOX WENT BACK ON PT XYZ, BUT UNDER THE PREVIOUS PT 123'S NAME. HERE IS WHERE THE MED ERROR CAME IN: THE PT 123 THEN CAME BACK FROM SURGERY. IT IS UNCLEAR IF PT 123 HAD A TELEMETRY BOX ON OR NOT. HOWEVER, PT XYZ'S EKG RHYTHM CHANGED TO RAPID AFIB IN THE 150'S. HOWEVER, THE MONITOR TECH CALLED THE NURSE ON THE OTHER UNIT, BASED ON THE PT'S 123 NAME ON THE SCREEN. PT 123 RECEIVED DIGOXIN IVP, BASED ON PT XYZ'S RHYTHM. MEANWHILE, XYZ, WHO WAS ACTUALLY IN AFIB IN THE 150'S, DID NOT RECEIVE THIS MUCH NEEDED MEDICATION UNTIL SEVERAL HOURS LATER, AFTER THE ERROR WAS DISCOVERED, ONLY BY A CHARGE NURSE WHO WAS UPDATING HER MONITORING LOG Q SHIFT. PT 123 RECEIVED A MEDICATION NOT INTENDED FOR THEM, AND PT XYZ SUFFERED FROM A DELAY IN MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE OF THIS TELEMETRY BOX MIXUP.

THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT DESCRIPTION WAS PROVIDED TO CARIDIANBCT QUALITY ASSURANCE: DURING AUTOLOGOUS PBSC COLLECTION THERE WAS A LEAK AT THE BLOOD WARMER LUER CONNECTION. POST-PROCEDURE THE PT SUFFERED A LOW GRADE FEVER. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO THE COLLECTION OF BLOOD CULTURES FROM THE DONOR. (B)(4) - LEAK/WITH FEVER POST COLLECTION. CLINICAL SPECIALIST, CALLED THE CUSTOMER FOR F/U ON (B)(6) 2009 AND THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE PT IS DOING WELL. THE CUSTOMER SITE LEFT A VOICE MAIL ON (B)(6) 2009 FOR (B)(6) THAT DETAILED THE BLOOD CULTURE RESULTS; PRODUCT=NEGATIVE / NO GROWTH, PT'S BLOOD CULTURES = NEGATIVE / NO GROWTH, PT'S CENTRAL LINE TIP = NEGATIVE / NO GROWTH, AND BLOOD CULTURE DRAWN VIA THE CENTRAL LINE = NEGATIVE / NO GROWTH. CARIDIANBCT DISPOSABLE QUALITY RECEIVED A 10" SEGMENT OF ASTO TUBE WITH MALE LUER CONNECTION ATTACHED. THE CONNECTOR WAS EXAMINED UNDER MAGNIFICATION FOR DEFECTS, NONE WERE IDENTIFIED. THE INVESTIGATOR ATTACHED A FEMALE CAP ON THE MALE END, AND ATTEMPTED TO REPEAT THE LEAK USING WATER UNDER PRESSURE. THE INVESTIGATOR WAS NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE COMPLAINT. A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE LEAK INCLUDES A SLIGHT MFG INTERFERENCE DEFECT BETWEEN THE MALE LUER CONNECTION ON THE ASTO TUBE AND THE FEMALE LUER CONNECTION USED (NOT PROVIDED FROM CUSTOMER). ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE LEAK COULD BE OPERATOR ERROR IN ESTABLISHING THE CONNECTION. PER THE INFO PROVIDED FROM THE CUSTOMER, THE PT WAS SUFFERING FROM MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND THE FEVER COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE G-CSF THAT WAS ADMINISTERED. CONCLUSION: A ROOT CAUSE FOR THE LEAK AND PT FEVER CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME DUE TO MULTIPLE POSSIBLE CAUSES AND INSUFFICIENT INFO TO IDENTIFY ONE MAIN ROOT CAUSE.

1387752	0	i purchased an invacare model #isg4002654 blood pressure monitor after my doctor told me she wanted to monitor my blood pressure at home because she was considering putting me on high blood pressure medication. i made my first purchase in 2009. i used the monitor at home and my blood pressure according to the invacare machine was around 135/140 systolic, this was low enough that i did not need blood pressure medication. however, after having two more blood pressure checks at my doctor's that were over 150 systolic, i bought my invacare blood pressure monitor into my doctor's office and they made sure i was using it right, then we compared between the invacare model and the doctor's office bp machine. the numbers were off by more than 12 points systolic. we repeated the comparison with the same results. i called the company i purchased the machine from, united health care products, and they sent me an identical invacare bp machine. because of the above mentioned problem, i did not trust the machine so immediately compared it again with my doctor's machine. unfortunately, again the systolic and dia were always much lower than my doctor's machine. unfortunately again the systolic and dia were always much lower than my doctor's, bp machine. i called invacare for assistance and was told i must be doing something wrong. they wanted me to purchase a larger cuff, despite the fact that my bicep measurements are within their parameters for the cuff i have, and i can get two fingers in the cuff as instructed. invacare offered no further assistance with this matter. i now have two new blood pressure machines that repeatedly produce lower blood pressure states. i gave the machines to two friends that have normal blood pressure to also compare. they both reported the blood pressure machine reported consistently lower blood pressure readings. one of the friends is an army medic and he said, 'if my blood pressure was that low i would be dead.' i reported this to invacare in an e-mail and have received no response. my concern is that people like me that are border line in need of medication will rely on these machines and not get the medication they need or consult a doctor because they believe their blood pressure is ok. in my case my doctor went ahead and put me on blood pressure medication. but what of the thousands of people that purchase this machine and for whatever reason it reports very low blood pressure when they may in fact be in need of medication? i know that two machines do not make a scientific study, and i also realize that there still could be a user problem, but if that is the case, the problem is so difficult even a trained nurse and an army medic are not applying the cuff correctly, which is hard to believe. please investigate this issue, as the 'silent killer' may be taking people unnecessarily after they have relied on this machine. dates of use: 2009. diagnosis: high blood pressure monitoring.

(BCI) REGARDING LOW HEMOGLOBIN (HGB) AND PLATELET (PLT) RESULTS THAT WERE GENERATED BY THE COULTER AC T DIFF 2 INSTRUMENT FOR A SINGLE PATIENT SAMPLE. A PATIENT SAMPLE WAS TESTED FOR HGB AND PLT AND RESULTS OF 4.2G/DL AND 240 X 10 TO THE THIRD POWER CELLS/UL WERE OBTAINED RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS WERE REPORTED OUT OF THE LAB AND THE PATIENT WAS SENT TO A HOSPITAL AND REDRAWN. THE HOSPITAL'S RESULTS WERE HIGHER FOR BOTH ANALYTES; HGB RESULT WAS 9.1G/DL. PLT RESULT WAS 416 X 10 TO THE THIRD POWER CELLS/UL. THE HOSPITAL'S RESULTS WERE CONSIDERED CORRECT. ON THE NEXT DAY, THE CUSTOMER RE-TESTED THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE FOR HGB AND PLT AND RESULTS WERE: HGB RESULT WAS 9.7G/DL. PLT RESULT WAS 385 X 10 TO THE THIRD POWER CELLS/UL. BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED, THERE WAS NO AFFECT TO PATIENT OR USER AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. >< QC IS RUN ONCE A DAY. QC WAS PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER THE EVENT AND RESULTS WERE IN RANGE. THE SPECIMEN WAS COLLECTED IN A BD, 4ML TUBE AND RAN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES AFTER COLLECTION. THE SAMPLE WAS TESTED IN CLOSED VIAL WHOLE BLOOD MODE. A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS DISPATCHED TO THE CUSTOMER'S LAB: A) PER FSE, QC WAS PERFORMING PROPERLY. B) THE FSE INSPECTED FLUIDICS AND VERIFIED MIXING BUBBLES. C) THE FSE PERFORMED REPRODUCIBILITY USING NORMAL CONTROL MATERIAL AND OBTAINED PASSING RESULTS. D) THE FSE VERIFIED THE INSTRUMENT'S PERFORMANCE.

3388264	0	ON (B)(6) 2013, GE HEALTHCARE RECEIVED INFORMATION CONCERNING A DEVICE MALFUNCTION WITH NO ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENT. AN ORDER OF RAPIDSTRAND RX WAS SENT TO A USER FACILITY WITH INCORRECTLY LOADED BRACHYTHERAPY IMPLANT NEEDLES (ERROR IN THE CONFIGURATION OF LOADED SEEDS). BEFORE IMPLANTATION THE FACILITY WAS ADVISED BY GE HEALTHCARE OF THE ERROR AND WAS ABLE TO REVIEW THE CONFIGURATION OF THE IMPLANT. SINCE ALL NEEDLES WERE SYMMETRICALLY LOADED, THIS IMPLANT WAS NOT AFFECTED AND IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO THE TREATMENT PLAN. ALTHOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE THE IMPLANT WAS NOT AFFECTED, DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE ERROR WHICH RESULTED IN TWO OTHER INCORRECTLY LABELED IMPLANTS FOR DIFFERENT PATIENTS, THIS MALFUNCTION WAS ASSESSED AS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY SHOULD IT RECUR. QUALITY ASSURANCE INVESTIGATION (B)(4) IS ONGOING. CONCLUSIONS: ERROR BY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER COMPUTER OPERATOR WHEN ENTERING THE TREATMENT PLAN DETAILS INTO THE ORDER FULFILLMENT SOFTWARE. (E.G. ADDITIONAL LOT# 130247A). EVALUATION SUMMARY: PRELIMINARY EVALUATION RESULTS: THIS FAILURE OCCURRED BECAUSE THE PATIENT DOES PLAN PROVIDED WITH EACH ORDER WAS INCORRECTLY ENTERED BY GE HEALTHCARE'S CONTRACT MANUFACTURER, THERAGENICS, INTO THEIR OR (B)(4) FULFILLMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEM (SYSTEM OPERATOR ERROR) PRIOR TO ASSEMBLY. THE AFFECTED USER FACILITY PROVIDES PATIENT-SPECIFIC NEEDLE LOADING PLANS GENERATED FROM A SIMUPLAN PLATFORM. THIS PLATFORM GENERATES AND DISPLAYS THE LOADING PLAN AS INDIVIDUAL SEALED SOURCE IMPLANT NEEDLES PLAN IN THE OPPOSITE ORDER (FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AND NOT LEFT TO RIGHT) TO MOST COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS. THIS WAS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY THE NEEDLES BEING INCORRECTLY LOADED AS DETAILED BELOW. PATIENT DOES PLANT CONSISTED OF 66 IODINE-125 BRACHYTHERAPY SOURCES TO BE LOADED IN TO 23 IMPLANT NEEDLES. ALL NEEDLES HAD ASYMMETRICAL LOADING PLANS AND WERE CORRECTLY LOADED. THE CUSTOMER (BOTH DOCTORS AND PHYSICS DEPARTMENT) WAS ADVISED IN WRITING AND BY TELEPHONE BY GE HEALTHCARE CUSTOMER SERVICE, LOCAL SALES REPRESENTATIVE, AND THE GE HEALTHCARE MEDICAL DIRECTOR ON THE DAY BEFORE THE IMPLANT DATE. NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE NECESSARY FOR THE ORDER WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY IMPLANTED SUCCESSFULLY ACCORDING TO THE TREATMENT PLAN.

AFTER THE INSTRUMENT TROUBLE SHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, THE ANALYZER WAS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THIS ANALYZER (B)(4) OVER A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE. IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE AXSYM SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL THAT DETERMINATION OF THE AXSYM RESULTS MUST BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER CLINICAL DATA (SYMPTOMS, RESULTS OF OTHER TESTS AND PATIENTS HISTORY). THE ASSAY PACKAGE INSERT ADDRESSED THE PROBABLE CAUSES ALONG WITH THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR THIS ISSUE UNDER THE SECTION OF TROUBLE SHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED NOR WAS ANY DEFICIENCY IDENTIFIED FOR THIS COMPLAINT. THIS IS A FINAL REPORT.

2511134	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WBC CONTENT THAT WAS MEASURED IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT COLLECTION. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WHITE BLOOD CELL TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THE DISPOSABLE KIT WILL NOT BE RETURNED AS IT HAS BEEN DISCARDED. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). ANALYSIS OF THE RBC DETECTOR SIGNAL OUTPUT SHOWS CONSIDERABLE FLUCTUATION SUGGESTING THE PRESENCE OF POSSIBLE AGGREGATES IN THE COLLECT LINE (PRE-PUMP INSIDE THE CHAMBER) LEADING TO DISRUPTION OF THE COLLECTION. PRESENCE OF AGGREGATES MAY DISTURB THE PLATELET BED IN THE LRS CHAMBER AND THUS LEAD TO INADVERTENT RELEASE OF WHITE CELLS INTO THE PRODUCT. A DEFINITE CAUSE FOR THE AGGREGATES COULD NOT BE DERIVED FROM THE DLOG. FURTHERMORE THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGH LEVEL CONTAMINATION EVENTS (SATURATION) AND DONORS WITH ELEVATED BODY MASS INDEX (>30). IN THIS CASE THE BMI WAS CLOSE TO THIS LEVEL (=29.4).

THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE, NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(6) THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. INVESTIGATION:THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS (DHR) WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS LOT. THERE WERE NO EVENTS NOTED IN THE DHR THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE RUN DATA FILE WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. ROOT CAUSE: THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE INDICATE THAT THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT WAS LIKELY A RESULT OF AN ESCAPE OF WBCS FROM THE LRS CHAMBER DURING A PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE. THERE ARE NO EVENTS (ADJUSTMENTS, CHANGES IN PUMP SPEED,SUBSTATE CHANGES, ETC.) IN THE PROCEDURE THAT CORRESPONDS WITH THE ONSET OF THE OVERLOADING OF THE LRS CHAMBER. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THIS LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE COULD ALSO BE DONOR-RELATED.><INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS.

THIS MATTER IS ALSO DISPLAYED IN ITS SPECIFICATIONS. DESPITE COATED NEEDLES AS WELL AS RINSING STEPS, SUCH A PHENOMENON MAY OCCUR IN VERY RARE CASES, IS USUALLY BASED ON A SAMPLE-SPECIFIC REACTION AND CAN BE CAUSED BY A HIGH PROTEIN LEVEL IN PLASMA (INDUCED BY SEVERE SICKNESS OR APPLICATION OF DRUGS) OR ANTIBODIES WITH A HIGH TITRE. SINCE ANY SPECIMEN BEING CONSPICUOUS DUE TO A POSITIVE ABS RESULT SHOULD UNDERGO RETESTING AND BECAUSE ANY ABS POSITIVE SAMPLE FROM A BLOOD DONOR SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM TRANSFUSION, NO SERIOUS THREAT NEITHER FOR PT NOR USER OR DEVICE MAY ARISE DUE TO A CARRY-OVER EVENT. THE CORRECT FUNCTION OF THE AFFECTED REAGENTS WERE PROVED BY TESTING THE RETENTION SAMPLES OF OUR QUALITY CONTROL LAB IN TANGO. ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REACTIONS WERE CORRECT. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY FALSE POSITIVE REACTIONS. ACCORDING TO THE INTENDED USE OF THE ALSO AFFECTED REAGENT SOLIDSCREEN II ANTI-D BLEND THE TEST IS USED TO TEST DONOR SAMPLES WHICH HAVE BEEN TESTED NEGATIVE WITH IGM ANTI-D ON ERYTYPE S ON THE TANGO.

ROOT CAUSE: A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE REMAINS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. THE DISPOSABLE SET COULD NOT BE EVALUATED AS IT WAS NOT RETURNED. RDF ANALYSIS DETAILED A NUMBER OF ALERTS AND ALARMS AS WELL AS EVIDENCE OF CLUMPING/AGGREGATES AT THE START OF THE PROCEDURE. THESE ALARMS, ALERTS AND CLUMPING COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED RESIDUAL WBCS AS THEY COULD HAVE AFFECTED THE STABILITY OF THE INTERFACE. THE SIGNALS IN THE RUN DATA FILE ARE CONSISTENT WITH SOME POSSIBLE CLUMPING/AGGREGATION DURING THE BEGINNING OF PLATELET COLLECTION THAT COULD HAVE AFFECTED THE SEPARATION OF CELLS IN THE LRS CHAMBER. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THE CLUMPING/AGGREGATION AND RESULTING LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE COULD BE DONOR RELATED. WHILE THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM IS TYPICALLY ROBUST AGAINST NUMEROUS ACCESS ALERTS AND ADJUSTMENTS, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE HIGH NUMBER OF ALERTS AND ADJUSTMENTS OCCURRING AT THE BEGINNING OF PLATELET COLLECTION DISRUPTED THE STEADY-STATE OF THE SYSTEM AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT REPORTED FOR THIS PROCEDURE.><THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT.

6126707	0	leica biosystems received a complaint regarding poor processing of tissue samples from a processing run in retort a, which completed on (b)(6) 2016. the complainant reported that 150 blocks of tissue may have been adversely affected; the tissue samples smelt of alcohol and had not been processed. on 31 october 2016, leica biosystems received information from a leica field support specialist (fss) that tissue in five (5) blocks from three (3) cases was not diagnosable and re-biopsy had been advised (this information was received by leica biosystems (b)(4) on 01 november 2016). the fss also reported that: ..the customer agrees that they think an incorrect reagent was put on the instrument." an identifier  the age or date birth and the gender of each patient was requested. on 07 november 2016  leica biosystems (b)(4) received information that re-biopsy of two (2) patients was required. the date of birth and gender of each patient were also provided. refer to mfr. report# 8020030-2015-00076 for specific details of the other patient involved.><investigation of this complaint found that the reagent in bottles 4 (ethanol) and 13 (xylene) and the wax in wax chamber 4 had been replaced in the period prior to commencement of the "routine overnight 45" protocol started in retort a at 16:57pm on (b)(6) 2016  from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported by the complainant. the reagent in bottles 4 (ethanol) and 13 (xylene) was used for the final dehydration and clearing steps respectively of the "routine overnight 45" protocol started in retort a at 16:57pm on (b)(6) 2016. the instrument was found to have functioned as designed during execution of this protocol. based on information reported by a leica field support specialist that: "..the customer agrees that they think an incorrect reagent was put on the instrument" determined that the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported by the complainant was a use error  which occurred prior to commencement of the "routine overnight 45" protocol started in retort a at 16:57pm on (b)(6) 2016. as the reagents on the instrument at the time of the event had been discarded prior to attendance at the laboratory by a leica representative  it was not possible to either measure the ethanol concentration in bottles designed for this reagent or to perform chemical analysis of the reagent in bottles designated for xylene. as a consequence  it is not possible to establish whether the use error occurred during replacement of the reagent in either bottle 4 (ethanol) or 13 (xylene). the manufacturer instructions for manual reagent replacement are detailed in section 5.4.4 of the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual; and contain the following warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss."><on 26 january 2017  leica biosystems received the following information in written communication from the quality manager and head of department histopathology at the institution: "...we would like to express our disappointment on the reported findings  particularly in regards to the quote "...the customer agrees that they think an incorrect reagent was put on the instrument' we do not recall at any occasion we made such a statement." the written communication also included the following new information: "tissue processing issue was first reported on (b)(6) 2016 friday when in the morning the samples coming out of wax smelt of alcohol. the same day a few cases processed on (b)(6) were also returned from pathologist with processing problems. this has been caught during qa reporting." the clarifying information provided by the institution in the written communication indicates that a use error did not occur prior to commencement of the "routine overnight 45" protocol started in retort a at 16:57pm on (b)(6) 2016  from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported in the complaint received by leica biosystems on (b)(6) 2016; and as a consequence  the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported from the "routine overnight 45" protocol started in retort a at 16:57pm on (b)(6) 2016 could not be determined from the information available. investigation of the additional information provided regarding "processing problems" involving cases processed on (b)(6) 2016 found that two (2) processing runs either started or completed on this date. specifically  the "routine overnight 45" protocol which started in retort a at 16:35pm on (b)(6) 2016 and completed at 07:00am on (b)(6) 2016; and the "routine overnight 45" protocol which started in retort a at 16:59pm on (b)(6) 2016 and completed on (b)(6) 2016. evaluation of the instrument logs found that the instrument operated within specification during execution of these two (2) protocols; and there was no evidence of a user interaction with the instrument that would have adversely impacted the quality of the tissue processing from these two (2) protocols. the root cause of the "processing problems" reported from "routine overnight 45" protocols which started in retort a at 16:35pm on (b)(6) 2016 and 16:59pm on (b)(6) 2016 could not be determined from the information available."

6073629	0	a customer in the united states contacted biomerieux to report bacillus contamination associated with a bact/alert fa plus culture bottle. the culture bottle was inoculated in the emergency room (er). the corresponding box of bact/alert fa plus bottles was inspected and one empty bottle was found; this empty bottle had a hole in the bottom. this bottle was discarded. the customer then examined the contaminated bottle more closely and he observed that the label looked like it had gotten wet because the printing was slightly smeared and the paper looked slightly bubbled. he surmised that the bottle with the hole in it leaked media onto the contaminated bottle. he swabbed the label of the contaminated bottle and the subculture grew bacillus sp. the customer was not willing to provide photos of the bottle label; although he was willing to allow a biomerieux representative visit the lab. the customer stated that, to his knowledge, the patient was not harmed or required modified treatment due to the contamination issue. the customer stated they followed the collection instructions in their local sop. each bottle should have an alcohol pad placed over it until it is inoculated. review of the local sop by biomerieux personnel indicated the procedure does not state to wipe the bottle top and wait for the disinfectant to dry. it only states to remove flip cap and put an alcohol prep on top of each bottle. it should also state to wipe the bottle top and allow the alcohol to dry. the wiping action removes spores, and the drying action kills bacteria. biomerieux investigation will be initiated.><an internal biom?rieux investigation concluded the following: the organisms are not present within the bottle when received at the sites, but rather introduced to the bottle during inoculation at the testing site. the broad range of species and strains recovered indicate the contaminants do not stem from a single source. testing practices or environmental conditions at the testing site are the root cause. the root cause is not within the control of biom?rieux. an info bulletin will be issued to the field that describes the investigation results and re-emphasizes the preparation protocol described in the package insert.

A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. >< THE FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE DISCOVERED THE ARCHITECT WASH ZONE GROUND STRAP WAS CORRODED. THE GROUND STRAP WAS REPLACED WITHOUT INCIDENT OR INJURY. >< (B)(4). UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM CORROSION WHICH CAN FURTHER DEVELOP INTO AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND; THE COPPER PRESENT IN THE GROUND STRAP WAS EXPOSED TO SODIUM AZIDE FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME TO FORM CORROSION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. INDEPENDENT STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS FOUND ON FIELD RETURNED GROUND STRAPS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COPPER AZIDE DEPOSITS, FORMATION RATES OF COPPER AZIDE, THE FEASIBILITY OF STAINLESS STEEL AS A POTENTIAL GROUND STRAP MATERIAL AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. ONE STUDY REVEALED THERE ARE OTHER METALS, POTENTIALLY UTILIZED IN INSTRUMENT DESIGNS, THAT MAY FORM AN UNSTABLE AZIDE COMPOUND ARE GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, BRASS AND TIN. THE (B)(6) PERFORMED A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF STEEL AND TIN AS REPLACEMENT FOR COPPER. THE STUDY INDICATED THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXPLOSIVE AZIDES FORMED IF STEEL, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NICKEL AND CHROMIUM, COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BUFFER SOLUTION. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM AZIDE WAS CONDUCTED. OTHER PARTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING COPPER WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER MATERIAL WITH NO KNOWN POTENTIAL VOLATILE METAL FORMATIONS. INSTRUMENT DESIGNS WILL AVOID THE USE OF BARE COPPER OR TIN COATED COPPER IN AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO SODIUM AZIDE MIGHT BE EXPECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. THE MATERIAL OF THE GROUND STRAP WAS CHANGED TO A STAINLESS STEEL ALLOY. A MANDATORY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN REQUIRED THAT EVERY COPPER GROUND STRAP BE REPLACED BY FIELD SERVICE TO THE NEW STAINLESS STEEL STRAP. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STAINLESS STEEL WZ MECHANISM GROUND STRAP, INSTRUCTIONS ON THE REMOVAL AND PACKAGING OF POTENTIALLY CORRODED GROUP STRAPS WERE INCORPORATED INTO LABELING. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING FROM (B)(4) 2009 TO (B)(4) 2010 INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS WITH RESPECT TO CORROSION OR ADVERSE EVENTS IN CONJUNCTIONS WITH THE REPLACEMENT STAINLESS STEEL ARCHITECT WASH ZONE MECHANISM GROUND STRAP. PRODUCT LABELING WAS REVIEWED AND FOUND TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS INVOLVED WITH PRODUCTS CONTAINING SODIUM AZIDE; HOWEVER, LABELING WAS ENHANCED TO INCLUDE REFERENCE TO (B)(6).

5353662	1	description: during an investigation for a tpn compounding error, a potential contributing cause was that the 2 labels generated from the baxter exactamix /abacus software do not list ingredients in the same order and the naming of the ingredients are not consistent. the label that gets affixed to the tpn bag is designed to match the prescriber's tpn order (e.g., 1st ingredient is dextrose, 2nd is amino acids; salts are listed by their full name - sodium chloride"). the second label lists the "solution formula". the ingredients on the 2nd label do not match the order of the tpn bag label. also  salts are listed by the chemical name (e.g.  "na chloride"). this makes cross referencing the 2 labels during the checking process difficult. we contacted baxter to see if the order of the ingredients on the "solution formula" label could be changed to match the tpn label. they said this is not something that can easily be changed and it could be a major change that would cost us a lot of money. they also said that the name of the ingredients ("na chloride") cannot be changed. baxter should not make it costly / difficult to change the order of ingredients to match the tpn label. no one orders tpn ingredients in the manner they currently have been listed (na chloride 1st  dextrose and amino acids are in the middle of the list). they should also use normal naming conventions for ordering salts (sodium chloride  potassium chloride - not na chloride and k chloride).

1781891	1	IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT MULTIPLE ECGS WERE RECONCILED TO ONE ORDER IN OUR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR). THE ECG REQUEST IS PLACED IN THE EPIC EMR, SENT TO THE PHILIPS TRACE MASTERVUE. THE ECG IS RECORDED ON AN ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY CART AND THEN RECONCILED IN THE TRACE MASTERVUE TO THE EPIC ORDER NUMBER. WHEN MORE THAN ONE ECG IS RECONCILED TO A PARTICULAR ORDER, THE LATEST ECG RECONCILED TO THE ORDER WILL LINK TO THAT ORDER IN THE EMR. SPECIFICALLY, IF A PATIENT HAS AN ECG AT 8 AM (AND IT IS RECONCILED TO ORDER #1) AND THEN HAS A SECOND ECG THAT DAY AT 12 P.M., IT SHOULD BE RECONCILED TO ORDER #2 (GIVEN THE CLINICIAN ENTERED A SECOND ORDER FOR THE PATIENT.) IF THE SECOND ECG IS RECONCILED TO ORDER #1, IT WILL LINK TO THAT ORDER AND REPLACE THE FIRST ECG. A SECOND ISSUE RECOGNIZED IS THAT ON OCCASION ECGS FROM DIFFERENT PATIENTS WERE RECONCILED TO THE SAME ORDER CAUSING PATIENT MISMATCHES. THERE WERE 10 CASES IDENTIFIED, ALL WERE INVESTIGATED AND RESULTED IN NO PATIENT HARM.HEALTH PROFESSIONAL'S IMPRESSION: MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR).MANUFACTURER RESPONSE FOR ECG MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, TRACE MASTERVUE:MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF PATIENT MISMATCH WHEN ORDER IS RE-USED BUT DO NOT HAVE A SOLUTION.

885660	0	THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. FOUR CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT CAN LEAD TO A STOP OF THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) WHEN THE SAMPLE IS PRESENTED TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE FOR ASPIRATION: REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM A ROUTINE BAY WHILE THE ACCESS INDICATOR IS AMBER; - OPENING AN RSH COVER WHILE THE RSH IS IN THE RUNNING STATE; - USER REQUESTING STOP EITHER ON THE RSH KEYPAD OR FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN ON THE SYSTEM CONTROL CENTER; - A NON-RECOVERABLE HARDWARE FAILURE OF AN RSH MECHANISM. INVESTIGATION OF THE ISSUE DISCOVERED A TIMING-DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY-REMOVAL DOES NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CLINICAL CHEMISTRY MODULE. THIS CONDITION CAUSES THE MODULE TO RECEIVE AN ERRONEOUS SAMPLE ARRIVAL FOR TESTS/SAMPLES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DELETED WHEN THE RSH NOTIFIED THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE OF THE TRAY REMOVAL ERROR CONDITION. AFTER A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY THE MODULE SENDS AN EQUALLY ERRONEOUS SAMPLE FREE MESSAGE THAT CAUSES THE RSH TO INDEX THE CARRIER TO THE NEXT POSITION. AT THAT POINT THE SEQUENCE OF SAMPLING IS OFF BY ONE CARRIER POSITION. THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED IN SOFTWARE VERSION 3.00 FOR THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM, BUT ALL SOFTWARE VERSIONS THAT SUPPORTED AN INTERFACE TO THE C8000 AND/OR THE C16000 AND RSH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS ISSUE (V2.00, V2.01, V2.02, V2.03, V2.10, V2.11, V2.20, V2.20 DB UPDATE, V2.60, V2.30, V3.00 AND V3.10). THE ISSUE CAN OCCUR ON THE C8000 AND C16000 SYSTEMS SINCE THE RSH AND THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE ARE COMMON TO BOTH CONFIGURATIONS. THE ISSUE WAS FOUND TO BE DUE TO A TIMING- DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY REMOVAL WOULD NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE. LABELING: THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL CONTAINS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE USE AND FUNCTION OF THE RSH IN SECTION 1. STATUS INDICATORS INDICATES THE STATUS OF SAMPLE PROCESSING AND WHEN THE OPERATOR CAN ACCESS SAMPLES. A STEADY AMBER LIGHT INDICATES THAT SAMPLES ARE PROCESSING AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED. SECTION 5: OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS; SUBSECTION: SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PROVIDES PROCEDURES FOR LOADING SAMPLES ONTO THE RSH FOR PROCESSING. THE PROCEDURE 'ACCESS A SAMPLE WITH TESTS IN PROCESS' ADVISES THE OPERATOR TO PERFORM THIS PROCEDURE TO SUSPEND A BAY ON THE RSH WHEN IMMEDIATE ACCESS IS NEEDED TO A SAMPLE THAT IS BEING PROCESSED. IMPROPER REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM THE RSH WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE ERROR CODE 0273 (REMOVAL FROM THE PRIORITY BAY) OR 0274 (REMOVAL FROM THE ROUTINE BAY). THE STOPPED STATUS FOR THE RSH IS DESCRIBED IN TABLE 1.3. CONDITIONS FOR THE RSH TO BE STOPPED INCLUDE:- THE OPERATOR HAS SELECTED F6- STOP FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN OR THE STOP KEY ON THE SAMPLE HANDLER KEYPAD;- ONE OF THE RSH COVERS WAS OPENED WHILE THE SAMPLE HANDLER WAS RUNNING;- SAMPLE HANDLER DETECTED A FATAL ERROR WHILE PROCESSING. THE OPERATOR IS ADVISED IN SECTION 7: OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TO 'KEEP ALL PROCESSING MODULE AND SAMPLE HANDLER DOORS CLOSED AND COVERS IN PLACE UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE IN A MAINTENANCE OR TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE' WHILE OPERATING THE SYSTEM. OPENING A COVER DURING OPERATION WILL RESULT IN THE GENERATION OF ERROR CODE 0709, RSH STOPPED, COVER OPENED. TROUBLESHOOTING ASSISTANCE FOR ALL ERROR CODES IS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS. >< THE CUSTOMER STATED TEST RESULTS ON THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, SAMPLE 1 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 2, SAMPLE 2 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 3, ETC. THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) GENERATED ERROR CODES 0274, TRAY IN BAY (X) WAS REMOVED BEFORE ACCESS WAS GRANTED, AND 0526, EMPTY TRAY DETECTED IN BAY (X), INDICATING THAT THE OPERATOR HAD INAPPROPRIATELY REMOVED A TRAY FROM THE RSH. CODE 0304, TRANSPORTER ERROR ALSO OCCURRED. THE RSH WENT TO STOPPED STATUS WHILE THE PROCESSING MODULE REMAINED IN RUNNING. THE OPERATOR ORDERED RERUNS FROM THE EXCEPTION SCREEN AND BEGAN TO RUN AGAIN. THE OPERATOR SUSPECTED AN ABERRANT RESULT ON A SAMPLE AND STOPPED THE RUN. REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE RESULTS WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. SAMPLE #9 HAD THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE #10. THE OPERATOR FOUND 28 CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES THAT WERE AFFECTED. THIRTEEN OF THE RESULTS HAD ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE DOCTOR, BUT NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED.

EVALUATION - UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM CORROSION WHICH CAN FURTHER DEVELOP INTO AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND; THE COPPER PRESENT IN THE GROUND STRAP WAS EXPOSED TO SODIUM AZIDE FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME TO FORM CORROSION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. INDEPENDENT STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS FOUND ON FIELD RETURNED GROUND STRAPS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COPPER AZIDE DEPOSITS, FORMATION RATES OF COPPER AZIDE, THE FEASIBILITY OF STAINLESS STEEL AS A POTENTIAL GROUND STRAP MATERIAL AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. ONE STUDY REVEALED THERE ARE OTHER METALS, POTENTIALLY UTILIZED IN INSTRUMENT DESIGNS, THAT MAY FORM AN UNSTABLE AZIDE COMPOUND ARE GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, BRASS AND TIN. THE (B)(4) PERFORMED A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF STEEL AND TIN AS REPLACEMENT FOR COPPER. THE STUDY INDICATED THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXPLOSIVE AZIDES FORMED IF STEEL, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NICKEL AND CHROMIUM, COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BUFFER SOLUTION. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM AZIDE WAS CONDUCTED. OTHER PARTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING COPPER WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER MATERIAL WITH NO KNOWN POTENTIAL VOLATILE METAL FORMATIONS. INSTRUMENT DESIGNS WILL AVOID THE USE OF BARE COPPER OR TIN COATED COPPER IN AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO SODIUM AZIDE MIGHT BE EXPECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. THE MATERIAL OF THE GROUND STRAP WAS CHANGED TO A (B)(4). A MANDATORY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN REQUIRED THAT EVERY COPPER GROUND STRAP BE REPLACED BY FIELD SERVICE TO THE NEW (B)(4) STRAP. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A (B)(4) WZ MECHANISM GROUND STRAP, INSTRUCTIONS ON THE REMOVAL AND PACKAGING OF POTENTIALLY CORRODED GROUP STRAPS WERE INCORPORATED INTO LABELING. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING FROM (B)(4) 2009 TO (B)(4) 2010 INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS WITH RESPECT TO CORROSION OR ADVERSE EVENTS IN CONJUNCTIONS WITH THE REPLACEMENT (B)(4) ARCHITECT WASH ZONE MECHANISM GROUND STRAP.

THE CUSTOMER REPORTED A BACT/ALERT® FA PLUS BOTTLE (P/N 410851) THAT, UPON BEING ENTERED INTO THE OBSERVA SYSTEM, WAS LINKED TO ANOTHER PATIENT IN THE SYSTEM. THE EXACT LOT OF THE BOTTLES INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE CUSTOMER. THE POTENTIAL LOTS IN USE AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT WERE MANUFACTURED IN FEBRUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL OF 2015, AND THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT WAS RECEIVED IN (B)(6) 2015. THE BOTTLE WAS ENTERED INTO THE OBSERVA SYSTEM ON (B)(6) 2015. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE BOTTLE WAS SCANNED OR MANUALLY ENTERED (TYPED) INTO THE OBSERVA SYSTEM FOR THE LOADING EVENT ON (B)(6) 2015. A PROBABLE SCENARIO OF THE DUPLICATE LABEL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER IS THAT, DURING THE ORIGINAL LOADING EVENT ON (B)(6) 2015, THE BOTTLE ID WAS MANUALLY TYPED INTO THE INSTRUMENT AND A TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR WAS CREATED AT THAT TIME. THE EVENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED, HOWEVER, UNTIL THE SECOND EVENT A WEEK LATER ON (B)(6) 2015 WHEN THE BOTTLE IMPRINTED WITH THAT ID ON THE BARCODE WAS SCANNED INTO THE OBSERVA SYSTEM. QUALITY SYSTEMS CONFIRMED THAT THE BOTTLE LABEL SUPPLIER HAS CONTROLS IN PLACE TO ASSURE THAT IN THE EVENT A DUPLICATE LABEL WAS GENERATED, THAT IT WOULD BE IDENTIFIED, PROPERLY QUARANTINED, AND NEVER SENT TO BIOMERIEUX.

THAT PATIENT WAS KEPT IN THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE ROOM WHILE THEIR IV LINES WERE BEING SWITCHED OVER TO TWO MR COMPATIBLE PUMPS, ONE OF WHICH ENCOUNTERED AN UNEXPECTED AIR-IN-LINE CONDITION CAUSING A DELAY. DURING THAT DELAY, THE ECG MODULE STARTED TO SMOLDER AND QUICK-THINKING STAFF REMOVED IT FROM THE EXAM ROOM AND CALLED A CODE RED. THERE WAS NO HARM TO THE PATIENT OR STAFF. THE PRINCIPLE CONCERN, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE DEVICE HAS A SHORT LEAD SET SO THAT WHEN IT IS CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRODES ON A PATIENT'S CHEST, IT IS THEN LAID ON THE CHEST AND CONNECTED VIA A FIBEROPTIC CABLE TO THE ACTUAL DISPLAY MONITOR. A TECH GRABBED THE SMOLDERING DEVICE BY THE LEAD SET AND TOOK IT DOWN A DIFFERENT HALLWAY AND PLACED IT ON ANOTHER MR TABLE THAT IS KEPT THERE.  A LITTLE LATER, HE MOVED IT TO THE FLOOR.

1960241	0	IT WAS REPORTED THAT A FIELD ENGINEER EXPERIENCED LOWER BACK PAIN DURING PLANNED MAINTENANCE OF THE VOLUSON SYSTEM AFTER REMOVING AND REINSTALLING A CARD RACK WEIGHING APPROX 35 KG (77 LBS). REMOVAL WAS NECESSARY TO ACCESS AND SERVICE THE SYSTEM, BUT SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS SPECIFY THIS IS A TWO PERSON OPERATION. THE FIELD ENGINEER COMPLETED THE SERVICE AND DROVE HOME WITH BACK PAIN. THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE FIELD ENGINEER FURTHER EXPERIENCED SHARP BACK PAIN WHILE LIFTING, CARRYING, AND LOADING A 15 KG (33 LB) BOX INTO HIS CAR. THE COMBINED INJURY RESULTED IN LOST WORK TIME OF 6 DAYS. THIS INCIDENT IS CONSIDERED A SERVICE USE ERROR. THE FIELD ENGINEER REPORTED LIFTING THE CARD RACK WEIGHING APPROX 35 KG ALONE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A BACK INJURY. AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT, THE SERVICE INSTRUCTION WAS REVIEWED. THE SERVICE INSTRUCTION CLEARLY STATES: "TWO PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED WHEN MOVING ON INCLINES, OR LIFTING MORE THAN 16 KG". NO FURTHER ACTIONS ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME.

5123040	0	THE MANUFACTURER'S INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE INCIDENT HAPPENED WHEN BOTH THE ELEKTA OY SERVICE ENGINEER AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERS WERE ON SITE TO PERFORM AN AFTER-INSTALLATION SERVICE TO THE PILOT INTERNAL HELIUM RECYCLER (IHR). WHEN SERVICING THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY IN THE CABINET, THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED THE SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHANGING THE GAS COLLECTION PUMP. THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY RESEMBLES MECHANICALLY THE GAS COLLECTION PUMP ASSEMBLY, BUT DIFFERS IN RESPECT OF POWERING ARRANGEMENT: THE MAIN POWER CABLE OF THE CABINET IS CONNECTED TO THE DIN RAIL OF THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY FROM WHICH IT CONTINUES TO UPS. THE UPS POWERS THE CABINET. OUTPUTS OF THE UPS WERE DETACHED ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTION, BUT THE MAIN POWER CABLE WAS STILL IN CONTACT WITH MAINS POWER AND THUS ALSO THE DIN RAIL OF THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY WAS HAVING THE MAINS VOLTAGE. THE ELECTRIC SHOCK SOURCE WAS THE MAIN POWER CABLE. THE SERVICE ENGINEER DETACHED THE MAIN POWER CABLE FROM THE DIN RAIL, AND THE BARE END OF THE CABLE TOUCHED HIS ARM. THE MAIN POWER CABLE COULD HAVE BEEN DEPOWERED BY SWITCHING THE POWER OFF FROM THE MAIN SWITCH. POWER SUPPLY OF THE DEVICE IS FED THROUGH A MEDICAL SAFETY ISOLATION TRANSFORMER. IN THIS CASE THE MEDICAL SAFETY ISOLATION TRANSFORMER PREVENTED WORSE OUTCOME, AS INTENDED. ONLY TRAINED ELEKTA SERVICE ENGINEERS ARE ALLOWED TO WORK ON THE IHR. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SERVICE MANUAL THERE IS A GENERAL INSTRUCTION TO ALWAYS DEPOWER THE SYSTEM FROM THE MAIN SWITCH, BUT THIS INSTRUCTION IS NOT REPEATED SEPARATELY FOR EACH TASK. AS THERE WERE BOTH SERVICE AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PARTICIPATING TO THE SERVICE, THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME CONFUSION REGARDING WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE MAINS POWER IS POWERED OFF. THE ULTIMATE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE INCIDENT WAS HUMAN ERROR. ELEKTA OY HAS OPENED (B)(4) TO HANDLE THE CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS. AS THE ACTIONS INCLUDED AN UPDATE IN THE FIELD, ELEKTA OY HAS REPORTED THE FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION UNDER REFERENCE NUMBER FCA-OY-0001 ON 30TH OCTOBER 2015. THE CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS ARE LISTED AS FOLLOWS:- - REFRESHER TRAINING ON ELECTRICAL SAFETY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ELEKTA OY SERVICE ENGINEERS. ALSO, ALL ELEKTA OY EMPLOYEES WHO WORK ON ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS HAVE ATTENDED ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL ELECTRICAL SAFETY TRAINING. - ELEKTA OY WILL CREATE A PROCEDURE FOR ELECTRICAL WORK. ALL APPLICABLE EMPLOYEES WILL BE TRAINED. ESTIMATED COMPLETION BY END OF JANUARY 2016. - THE DESIGN OF ALL NEW IHRS HAS BEEN CHANGED, SO THAT THE MAIN POWER CABLE IS RE-ROUTED NOT GO THROUGH THE COVER OF THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY. IN ADDITION, A WARNING STICKER HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE DESIGN TO REMIND THE SERVICE ENGINEER TO ALWAYS DEPOWER THE MAINS POWER BEFORE SERVICING. THIS DESIGN CHANGE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO THE DEVICES ON THE FIELD THROUGH THE FCA-OY-0001. NOTE THAT THE WARNING STICKER HAS ALREADY BEEN ATTACHED TO THE DEVICES IN THE FIELD. - THE IHR SERVICE MANUAL WILL BE UPDATED SO THAT THE INSTRUCTION TO DEPOWER THE INSTALLATION IS STATED IN THE BEGINNING OF EACH TASK. ESTIMATED COMPLETION BY END OF JANUARY 2016. - ELEKTA OY MANUAL VALIDATION INSTRUCTION HAS BEEN UPDATED TO INCLUDE A REVIEW OF AN ELECTRICAL SAFETY EXPERT FOR SERVICE AND INSTALLATION MANUALS. ESTIMATED RELEASE BY END OF JANUARY 2016. THE DESIGN CHANGE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF APRIL 2016. THE MANUFACTURER IS NOT AWARE OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH THIS TYPE OF MEDICAL DEVICE WITH A SIMILAR ROOT CAUSE. THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN THE US.><AN ELEKTA SERVICE ENGINEER WAS PERFORMING A SERVICE OPERATION OF THE HELIUM RECYCLER CABINET OF THE INTERNAL HELIUM RECYCLER (IHR). DURING THE SERVICE, HE GOT AN ELECTRIC SHOCK IN HIS ARM DUE TO WHICH THE ARM WAS TEMPORARILY NUMB BUT THERE WAS NO PERMANENT INJURY. THE ENGINEER VISITED THE DOCTOR AND HAD A HEALTH CHECK THE FOLLOWING DAY. EVERYTHING WAS OK. WHEN SERVICING THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY IN THE CABINET, THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED THE SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHANGING THE GAS COLLECTION PUMP. THE POWER CABLE OF THE CABINET IS CONNECTED TO DIN RAIL OF THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY FROM WHICH IT CONTINUES TO THE UPS (UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY). THE UPS POWERS THE CABINET. OUTPUTS OF THE UPS WERE DETACHED ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTION, BUT THE MAIN POWER CABLE WAS STILL IN CONTACT WITH MAINS POWER AND THUS ALSO THE DIN RAIL OF THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY WAS HAVING THE MAINS VOLTAGE.

THE DEVICE MEASURES MAGNETIC FIELD, WHICH IS VERY WEAK, AND CAN ONLY BE MEASURED WITH SUPER CONDUCTING SENSORS. THUS THE SENSORS ARE KEPT IN LIQUID HELIUM. THE PART INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS THE INTERNAL HELIUM RECYCLER (IHR), WHICH IS AN OPTIONAL NON-MEDICAL DEVICE BUT WILL BECOME A PART OF MEDICAL DEVICE WHEN INSTALLED. THE PURPOSE OF THE IHR IS TO REDUCE THE HELIUM CONSUMPTION. THE IHR IS AN OPTION FOR THE MAIN SYSTEM. THERE ARE ONLY TWO INSTALLATIONS WORLD WIDE, BOTH IN (B)(4). THE MANUFACTURER'S PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE INCIDENT HAPPENED WHEN BOTH THE ELEKTA OY SERVICE ENGINEER AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERS WERE ON SITE TO PERFORM AFTER-INSTALLATION SERVICE TO THE PILOT DEVICE. IN THE FUTURE, ONLY ELEKTA SERVICE ENGINEERS ARE ALLOWED TO SERVICE IHR, THUS HOSPITAL ENGINEERS WILL NEVER SERVICE THE IHR. AT PRESENT, THERE ARE ONLY FOUR SERVICE ENGINEERS TRAINED TO WORK ON IHR, ALL ELEKTA OY EMPLOYEES. WHEN SERVICING THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY IN THE CABINET, THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED THE SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHANGING THE GAS COLLECTION PUMP. THE POWER CABLE OF THE CABINET IS CONNECTED TO THE DIN RAIL OF THE COMPRESSOR ASSEMBLY FROM WHICH IT CONTINUES TO UPS. THE UPS POWERS THE CABINET.

1098663	0	THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT THE ARCHITECT C8000 ANALYZER GENERATED ERRATIC PHOSPHORUS ASSAY RESULTS ON A PATIENT SAMPLE. A PATIENT SAMPLE GENERATED AN INITIAL PHOSPHORUS RESULT OF 7.9 MG/DL, AND THE PHOSPHORUS RESULTS OF 4.4 MG/DL AND 4.3 MG/DL WHEN THE SAMPLE WAS REPEATED. THE LOWER RESULT WAS REPORTED OUTSIDE OF THE LABORATORY. THE CONTROLS WERE IN RANGE. THERE WAS NO ADVERSE IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT DUE TO THIS ERRATIC RESULT. >< AN INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED IN RESPONSE TO THE CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT OF A DISCREPANT PHOSPHORUS PATIENT RESULT GENERATED BY THE ARCHITECT C8000 ANALYZER, IN 2008. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ISSUE CONSISTED OF A REVIEW OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, CURRENT C8000 LABELING, AND THE INFORMATION PROVIDED INCLUDING THE COMPLAINT TEXT. THE REPLACEMENT OF THE DAMAGED MIXER 1 APPEARS TO HAVE RESOLVED YOUR C8000 DISCREPANT RESULT ISSUE. NO ADDITIONAL DISCREPANT RESULT OCCURRENCES BY C8000 HAVE BEEN REPORTED SINCE THE BENT MIXER 1 WAS REPLACED. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THE ARCHITECT CSYSTEM WAS PERFORMED OVER THE TIME PERIOD 2008. THIS SEARCH DID NOT FIND OTHER COMPLAINTS CONCERNING ERRATIC RESULTS FOR THE PHOSPHORUS ASSAY. THE C8000 OPERATIONS MANUAL PROVIDES MULTIPLE PROBABLE CAUSES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO ASSIST THE CUSTOMER WITH RESOLVING ERRATIC/DISCREPANT RESULTS: OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS UNDER, LIMITATIONS OF RESULT INTERPRETATION STATING THAT ASSAY RESULTS MUST BE USED WITH OTHER CLINICAL DATA, FOR EXAMPLE, SYMPTOMS, OTHER TEST RESULTS, PATIENT HISTORY, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM CLINICAL EVALUATION, AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES. ALL DATA MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR PATIENT CARE MANAGEMENT. IF ASSAY RESULTS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL EVIDENCE, ADDITIONAL TESTING IS SUGGESTED TO CONFIRM THE RESULT. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR ITS INTENDED USE. TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS DESCRIBES THE PROBABLE CAUSE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION(S) FOR MIXER MALFUNCTION UNDER ERRATIC RESULTS, POOR PRECISION - PHOTOMETRIC RESULTS (C SYSTEM). A MALFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM AND REAGENT APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURRED. THE COMPLAINT TEST STATES THE CUSTOMER REPLACED MIXER 1 AND NO ADDITIONAL ISSUES WERE OBSERVED. THIS IS A FINAL REPORT. END OF REPORT.
1083548	1	a hospital facility reported on june 27, 2008, that a pt suffering from dementia arrived in the emergency department approx three months prior. the pt had a medication order placed by a physician on a custom order entry screen and received a medication to which he was allergic resulting in an allergic reaction requiring standard treatment. he fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital within 48 hrs. the custom order entry screen displayed a placeholder indicating no allergy info had been recorded on this visit. there was a historical allergy entry that did not display on the custom order entry screen, but did display on all other screens. the customer order entry screen is intended for ancillary orders (e.g., labs, x-rays, nursing orders) and is not intended for use with medication orders. the custom order entry screen requires a medical record number (obtained via registration) to display allergies from previous visits.
2540909	0	ON (B)(6) 2011, A MALE PT WAS IMPLANTED WITH 65 RAPIDSTRAND RX SEEDS OF 12.58 MBQ (0.340 MCI ACTIVITY ON IMPLANT DATE) FOR BRACHYTHERAPY OF PROSTATE CANCER. PER (B)(4), THE SEEDS MAY HAVE BEEN MIXED WITH ANOTHER SEEDS ORDERS OF 16.06 MBQ (0.434 MCI) AND/OR 12.42 MBQ (0.336 MCI), RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL RADIATION OVER-DOSE OR UNDER-DOSE RESPECTIVELY (UNDER-DOSE NOT SIGNIFICANT PER MODEL). TO DATE, NO ADVERSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED TO THE COMPANY FOR THIS PT. THE ORDERED SEED ACTIVITY AND TREATMENT PLAN FOR THIS PT WAS REVIEWED BY THE GE HEALTHCARE MEDICAL GROUP AGAINST THE SEED ACTIVITY IN THE ORDER RELEVANT TO THE POSSIBLE MIX-UP. WORST-CASE SCENARIO, 100% SWAP, WAS ASSUMED AND THE POTENTIAL OVER-DOSE OR UNDER-DOSE CALCULATED. GE HEALTHCARE HAS NOTIFIED THE PHYSICIAN WHO PERFORMED THE SEED IMPLANT IN WRITING AND BY TELEPHONE AND IS FOLLOWING UP FOR FURTHER INFO. EVAL SUMMARY: GE HEALTHCARE QUALITY ASSURANCE INVESTIGATION REPORT (B)(4)/ GE HEALTHCARE WAS MADE AWARE OF A POTENTIAL FOR INCORRECT LOADING OF RAPIDSTRAND RX NEEDLES DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE ON THE PART OF ONE TECHNICIAN AT THE RADIOPHARMACY IN WHICH BRACHYTHERAPY IMPLANTS WERE PREPARED. FOUR INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED IN WHICH SEEDS HAD BEEN SWAPPED BETWEEN ORDERS RESULTING IN INCORRECTLY LOADED NEEDLES (MDR REPORT ID: 2915056-2011-00001, 2915056-2011-00002), OR INCORRECT CALIBRATION STRANDS BEING PROVIDED WITH THE ORDER (MDR REPORT ID: 2915056-2011-00003, 2915056-2011-00006), RESULTING IN MISLABELING OF THE DEVICE. INVESTIGATION OF THESE INCIDENTS AT THE LOADING FACILITY SHOWED THAT THE TECH HAD WORKED ON TWO ORDERS AT THE SAME TIME AND MIXED THE SEEDS BETWEEN THEM. GE HEALTHCARE REVIEWED ALL (B)(4) ORDERS THAT THE TECH COMPLETED DURING EMPLOYMENT AND IDENTIFIED (B)(4) WHERE THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY FOR SEEDS BEING MIXED BETWEEN TWO OR MORE ORDERS. THIS WAS DETERMINED BY IT BEING POSSIBLE FOR THE TECH TO HAVE WORKED ON TWO OR MORE SAME-PRODUCT ORDERS SIMULTANEOUSLY WHERE SEEDS OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITY WERE INVOLVED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED THAT SEEDS WERE MIXED BETWEEN THE ORDERS, ONLY THAT THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS. MIXING SEEDS BETWEEN ORDERS IS PRESUMED TO AFFECT RADIATION EXPOSURE TO THE AREA SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (PROSTATE GLAND, URETHRA, AND RECTUM), EITHER AN OVER-DOSE WHERE HIGHER ACTIVITY SEEDS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE LOADED NEEDLES CARRYING INCREASED RISK OF RADIATION SIDE-EFFECTS, OR UNDER-DOSE WHERE LOWER ACTIVITY SEEDS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE LOADED NEEDLES CARRYING RISK OF SUB-OPTIMAL TREATMENT OF THE TUMOR. THE ORDERED SEED ACTIVITY AND TREATMENT PLAN FOR EACH OF THE (B)(4) PTS WAS REVIEWED AGAINST THE SEED ACTIVITY IN THE ORDER RELEVANT TO THE POSSIBLE MIX-UP. WORST-CASE SCENARIO, 100% SWAP, WAS ASSUMED AND THE CONSEQUENT OVER-DOSE OR UNDER-DOSE CALCULATED. GE HEALTHCARE RISK ASSESSMENT CONCLUDED THAT, FROM A MEDICAL VIEWPOINT, THE RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH AS A RESULT OF A RECURRENCE OF SUCH MISLABELING IS REMOTE.
2163545	1	SINCE THE INITIATION OF CPOE MECHANIZED AUTOMATION SYSTEMS TO ORDER BLOOD TESTS, THE INCIDENCE OF "NO DRAWS", RESULTING IN DELAYS IN DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY HAS INCREASED. RECONCILIATION MECHANISMS DO NOT EXIST TO ASSURE THAT 100% OF THE BLOOD, URINE, AND OTHER TESTS THAT WERE ORDERED WERE COMPLETED OR ADDRESSED. THE PHLEBOTOMISTS DEPEND ON COMPUTERIZED LABEL MAKERS AS THE TRIGGER AND NOTIFICATION TO DRAW BLOOD AND OBTAIN SPECIMEN. THERE ARE OTHER NOTIFICATIONS THAT BLOOD TESTS ARE NEEDED DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF DAY. THERE ARE SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS COMPLEX COMPUTER ORDERED AND CPOE DEPENDENT WORKFLOW FOR ERRORS TO BE FACILITATED, INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN CPOE AND THE LABEL MAKER. UNEXECUTED ORDERS FREQUENTLY REMAIN ON THE CPOE SCREEN FOR DAYS WITHOUT NOTIFICATION OF OPEN ORDERS. DELAYS IN DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY RESULT FROM THIS DEFECT IN THE ORDERING SYSTEMS. CRITICAL DIAGNOSIS WAS DELAYED FOR 48 HOURS IN THIS PT WITH ABNORMAL LIVER TESTS AND MULTI SYSTEM FAILURE. WHEN IT CAME TO ATTENTION BY SERENDIPITY THAT THERE WERE NOT ANY RESULTS FOR THE TESTS THAT WERE ORDERED, AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE USING THE CPOE TO GENERATE A COMPUTERIZED LABEL AND REQUISITION. THE SYSTEMS FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. THE REQUISITION WAS WRITTEN BY LONG HAND ON PAPER. THE ANCILLARY STAFF INVOLVED WITH THIS BECOME EXASPERATED SINCE IT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED.

1993905	1	DURING THE (B)(6) OF 2009, OUR RADIOLOGY PRACTICE SHIFTED FROM FILM-BASED MAMMOGRAPHY TO DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY. WITH DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY, OUR RADIOLOGISTS BEGAN PERFORMING ONLINE DIAGNOSIS USING CARESTREAM RIS-DIC SYSTEM. WHEN USING THE SYSTEM, THE RADIOLOGIST WILL CHOOSE A DROP DOWN MENU TO SELECT A BREAST DENSITY TYPE AND A BIRADS CATEGORY (OVERALL DIAGNOSIS). USING THE MOUSE, THE RADIOLOGIST MAY SELECT A PARTICULAR BREAST DENSITY OR A BIRADS CATEGORY ON AN ADMINISTRATIVE MONITOR, TO SHIFT THE MOUSE TO FOCUS TO THE (B)(6)-MONITORS TO SCROLL THROUGH DIGITAL IMAGES. IN SO DOING, THE SELECTIONS PREVIOUSLY MADE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE MONITOR FOR BREAST DENSITY AND BIRADS CATEGORY CHANGE AS THE RADIOLOGIST SCROLLS THROUGH IMAGES, EVEN THOUGH THE MOUSE IS POINTED TO A (B)(6) MONITOR. THE BIRADS CATEGORY ULTIMATELY SELECTED HAS SEVERAL CONSEQUENCES. IT IS IMPORTED AS A FINAL RESULT IN MAMMOGRAPHY REPORTS. IT IS USED TO DETERMINE THE CONTENT OF THE LAY LETTER TO THE PTS, INFORMING THEM THAT THE RESULT WAS NORMAL OR THAT ADDITIONAL IMAGING IS NEEDED. IT IS ALSO TO ESTABLISH THE INTERVAL FOR THE PTS NEXT APPOINTMENT, RANGING FROM THE IMMEDIATE NEED TO RETURN FOR ADDITIONAL IMAGING TO SIX MONTHS FOR A SHORT F/U OR TWELVE MONTHS FOR AN ANNUAL REMINDER. WHEN (B)(6) FIRST BECAME AWARE OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN (B)(6) 2009, WE NOTIFIED CARESTREAM PERSONNEL THROUGH A SERIES OF EMAILS THAT "USE OF A DROP DOWN MENU IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND IT NEEDED TO BE MODIFIED. A SOLUTION WAS PROPOSED TO SWITCH THE DROP DOWN MENU TO DISCRETE RADIO BUTTONS. (B)(6) PERSONNEL HAVE FOLLOWED UP WITH CARESTREAM ON THIS ISSUE NUMEROUS TIMES. WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET CARESTREAM HEALTH TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION. DATES OF USE: (B)(6) 2005 -- (B)(6) 2011.

1807553	0	1) THE PATIENT WAS IN PLACE ON THE ERCP (ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY) PROCEDURE TABLE WITH THE SAFETY STRAP ON.  HE HAD BEEN GIVEN A MILD SEDATIVE.  HE WAS LYING PRONE AND HAD LIMB EKG LEADS ON.2) THE TABLETOP WAS POSITIONED IN THE 'TOE' DIRECTION WITH APPROXIMATELY 6 TO 8 INCHES TO MAKE A LITTLE 'SHELF' SPACE AT THE HEAD END FOR VARIOUS PROCEDURAL SUPPLIES.  THE FOOT END, THEREFORE, EXTENDED PAST THE TABLE BASE BY THE SAME AMOUNT.3) THREE STAFF WERE IN THE ROOM: ANESTHESIOLOGIST, NURSE AND RESIDENT.4) THE RESIDENT THINKS THE TABLE STARTED TO TILT WHEN HE GRABBED THE HAND GRIP OF THE IMAGING CONSOLE AND STARTED TO PULL IT OVER THE PATIENT.  THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST THINKS THE RESIDENT GRABBED THE CONSOLE'S HANDGRIP AND POSITIONED THE CONSOLE OVER THE PATIENT TO TAKE A BASELINE PICTURE.  HE THEN LET GO AND TURNED AWAY AND THE TILTING BEGAN.  THE NURSE THINKS THAT NOBODY WAS DOING/TOUCHING ANYTHING WHEN THE TILTING BEGAN.  THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST THINKS THE LEVER SWITCH ON THE CONSOLE BECAME STUCK, PERHAPS NOT MECHANICALLY BUT ELECTRICALLY.5) THE NURSE REMEMBERS THAT THE TILTING WAS FAST.  THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST REMEMBERS THAT THE TILTING WAS FAST, TAKING 5 TO 7 SECONDS TO REACH ITS MAXIMUM POSITION.  IT DID NOT KEEP DRIVING ONCE IT REACHED ITS HIGHEST POSITION.  IT CUT OFF OR WAS CUT OFF.  THE CONSOLE AND TABLE ARE BOLTED TOGETHER SO BOTH TILT TOGETHER.6) THE FOOT END OF THE TABLE WENT UPWARD, THE HEAD END DOWNWARD.  IT WENT ALL THE WAY (APPROXIMATELY 75-80¿) UNTIL THE FOOTBOARD STRUCK THE PLASTIC COVER (OWING TO ITS BEING EXTENDED AS DESCRIBED IN #2, ABOVE) OF THE MAVIG MONITOR BOOM CEILING MOUNT AND BROKE PART OF IT.  THE PATIENT'S FEET WENT UP AND HEAD WENT DOWN.  THE PATIENT'S LEGS BENT AT THE KNEE.  THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST SUPPORTED THE PATIENT'S SHOULDERS AND KNEELED DOWN AS THE HEAD END WENT LOWER.  THE PATIENT'S IV WAS FINE.7) MEANWHILE, ON THE FLOOR, THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE TABLE FRAME AND THE FRONT COVER CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE CONMED ESU FOOTSWITCH.  THIS BROKE A PIECE OF THE TABLE'S FRONT COVER OFF AND DEFORMED THE FOOTSWITCH ENOUGH SO THAT IT COULD NO LONGER BE USED AND HAS TO BE REPLACED.8) IT PUSHED THE MONITOR BOOM IN THE HEAD DIRECTION UNTIL THE BOOM CAME IN CONTACT WITH A SHORT PARTITION NEAR THE CEILING THAT MARKS THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE PROCEDURE ROOM AND A SORT OF BACK ROOM.  THE BOOM STRUCK THE SHEETROCK OF THE PARTITION AND MADE A DENT 8 TO 10 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND DAMAGED THE COVER OF THE SWIVEL OF THE BOOM THAT THE MONITORS HANG FROM. 9) THE MAIN EMERGENCY POWER SWITCH ON THE WALL BETWEEN THE PROCEDURE ROOM AND THE BACK ROOM WAS PUSHED, SHUTTING OFF POWER TO THE WHOLE ERCP SYSTEM.10) THE ANESTHESIA MACHINE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITOR DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY KIND OF POWER INTERRUPTION.11) THE PATIENT WAS CAREFULLY UNSTRAPPED FROM THE TABLE AND, TOGETHER WITH THE MATTRESS, WAS SLID ONTO THE FLOOR WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO STAND UP.  AT LEAST FOUR AND AS MANY AS SIX PEOPLE HELPED WITH THIS.  THE PATIENT HAD HIS SCHEDULED PROCEDURE IN THE OTHER ERCP ROOM.12) GE SERVICE WAS CALLED AND WAS ON-SITE IN THE AFTERNOON.  THE GE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS ABLE TURN THE POWER BACK ON AND TILT THE TABLE BACK DOWN TO ITS NORMAL HORIZONTAL POSITION USING THE MANUAL POSITIONING CONTROLS ON THE TABLE'S FRONT COVER.

1550321	1	the user reported that they had a pt code in the ct room, and they grabbed the device to take the pt's nibp reading. the user stated that they believed that they tried to get a nibp reading before the base monitor was in communication with the display monitor and, as a result, the device would not take nibp reading. the customer stated that the pt was revived successfully. >< the device mfr's field service rep (fse) visited the customer site to evaluate the device. the fse was able to duplicate the reported problem and replaced the device's radio as a result of his eval. although the user reported a problem with nibp parameter, the actual problem was with the device's radio. the problem with the device's radio caused the requested nibp reading to not be transmitted from the display monitor (where it is initiated) to the base monitor (which actually takes the nibp reading). following replacement of the radio, the device was functionally tested per internal test procedures and returned to service by the user. the device mfr spoke to a clinician present during the reported incident in order to determine whether or not the device was a factor in the incident and outcome of the pt. the clinician stated that they were not using the device to monitor the pt at the time of the incident. when asked if the clinician thought there was a delay in treatment of the pt as a result of the device's malfunction, the clinician replied 'absolutely not, it had nothing to do with anything'. the clinician also expressed frustration with the questions being asked by the device mfr because she felt that 'the [device mfr's] monitor had nothing to do with what happened and [the device mfr] should never have been called in the first place'. if this malfunction were top recur, it would not lead to a serious injury or death because this malfunction would be obvious to the user. if the malfunction were to recur, the user is likely to utilize back-up monitor to proceed with the case, and this is what happened in this case. if a back-up monitor was unavailable and lack of a back-up monitor was to preclude the use of the scanning device in diagnosis, alternative diagnostic methods would be implemented as warranted for the pt.

2066580	1	IN JANUARY A BIOMED TECHNICIAN WAS CALLED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM TO ADDRESS A POSSIBLE DISPLAY PROBLEM AT THE PHILIPS CENTRAL STATION. DURING THE PROCESS OF TROUBLESHOOTING THE DISPLAY (NO PROBLEM WAS FOUND) A SECONDARY ISSUE WAS NOTED. TWO OF THE THREE PHILIPS CENTRALS WERE DISPLAYING ALARM CONDITIONS BUT NO AUDIO WAS NOTED. ON FURTHER INSPECTION IT WAS FOUND THAT BOTH SETS OF ALARM SPEAKERS WERE UNPLUGGED (THE POWER BLOCK WAS UNPLUGGED). THE BIOMED TECHNICIAN REPOWERED (PLUGGED IN THE POWER SOURCE) THESE SPEAKERS AND THEN ROUNDED (INSPECTED) THE NURSING UNIT AND FOUND A THIRD CENTRAL WHERE THE AUDIO CABLE HAD BECOME DISCONNECTED FROM THE SPEAKER INPUT. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE LIKELY BUT NOT NECESSARILY USER INTRODUCED PROBLEMS IT IS THE OPINION OF THE BIOMED THAT THIS PARTICULAR SPEAKER ARRANGEMENT MAKES DEFEATING THE ALARM SYSTEM TOO EASY WHICH CAN LEAD TO NO ALARM AUDIO WHEN IT IS NEEDED. WE HAVE HAD THESE SINCE 2007 AND OVER THE YEARS I HAVE SEEN THIS SEVERAL TIMES.

898720	0	THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE BROKEN TUBE IS THE CUSTOMER MISHANDLING THE WASTE SENSOR. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND A NEWER DESIGNED WASTE SENSOR HAS BEEN INSTALLED ON THE INSTRUMENT TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE REMOTE POSSIBILITY OF INJURY RESULTING FROM A SLIP AND FALL EVENT CAUSED BY WASTE FLUID OVERFLOW, THE FIRM IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING AN IMPROVED WASTE SENSOR DESIGN AS A REPLACEMENT TO THE CURRENT SENSOR. THIS NEW WASTE SENSOR DESIGN SHOULD ELIMINATE THE OBSERVED FAILURE MODE. THE WASTE SYSTEM ON THIS INSTRUMENT WAS UPGRADED WITH THE NEW SENSOR DESIGN IN 2007. COMPLETE FIELD IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SENSOR DESIGN TO BE COMPLETED BY THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS. THE NEWER WASTE SENSOR DESIGN WAS INTRODUCED TO THE MFG FLOOR EIGHT MONTHS EARLIER, A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SENT PENDING THE COMPLETION OF THE FIELD IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW WASTE SENSOR. >< A CUSTOMER SITE REPORTED WASTE FLUID HAD OVERFLOWED FROM THE WASTE CARBOY ON A BENCHMARK LT INSTRUMENT ONTO THE FLOOR WITHOUT AN ALARM. NO ONE WAS INJURED AND PT CARE WAS NOT AFFECTED. THE FIELD SVC ENGINEER EVALUATED THE UPGRADED WASTE SENSOR AND FOUND THE TUBE TO BE BROKEN FROM MISHANDLING, PREVENTING THE SENSOR FROM FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THE FSE (FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER) INSTALLED A NEWER DESIGNED WASTE SENSOR WHICH HAS THE TUBE COUNTER SUNK, PREVENTING LATERAL MOVEMENT WHICH PREVENTS THE CUSTOMER FROM BREAKING THE TUBE IF MISHANDLED. WHILE THERE IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY THAT A SLIP AND FALL EVENT DUE TO FLUID SPILL COULD RESULT IN DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY, ALL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY IS REMOTE.

THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT TEXT, A SEARCH FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, A REVIEW OF LABELING AND A REVIEW OF THE ARCHITECT C8000 SYSTEM LOGS. A REVIEW OF THE ARCHITECT C8000 SYSTEM LOGS CONFIRMED THE ELEVATED CHLORIDE RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, A REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM MAINTENANCE LOGS REVEALED THE "FLUSH BULK SOLUTIONS" PROCEDURE HAD BEEN PERFORMED EARLY ON THE DAY THE DISCREPANT RESULTS WERE GENERATED AND AGAIN AFTER THE RESULTS WERE GENERATED. A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ISSUE IS THAT THE ICT MODULE MAY HAVE CONTAINED A BUBBLE AND/OR WAS CONTAMINATED AND THE BULK SOLUTION FLUSH MAY HAVE RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE INSTRUMENT HISTORY LOG INDICATED AN "ICT REFERENCE SOLUTION INVENTORY LOW" ERROR WAS GENERATED, SUGGESTING THE ICT SOLUTION WAS INSTALLED JUST PRIOR TO THE DISCREPANT CHLORIDE RESULTS. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING FOR THE PERIOD OF (B)(4) 2010 THROUGH (B)(4) 2010 DID NOT REVEAL ANY ISSUES OR ADVERSE TRENDS RELATED TO THE ICT REFERENCE SOLUTION LOT 37992UN10.

5128810	1	FUJIFILM MEDICAL SYSTEMS U.S.A., INC. (FMSU) RECENTLY COMPLETED A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF COMPLAINT FILES FROM 2013 THROUGH 2015 AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS COMPLAINT MEETS THE THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING. FMSU IS THEREFORE REPORTING IT AT THIS TIME. AN EXAM AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL IN (B)(6), WAS ENTERED MANUALLY ON THE MODALITY AND THE ACCESSION NUMBER WAS ENTERED INCORRECTLY BY THE TECHNOLOGIST. AS A RESULT, THE EXAM WAS SENT FROM THE MODALITY TO THE PATIENT EXAM FOLDER IN SYNAPSE MATCHING THE ACCESSION NUMBER THAT WAS ENTERED. THIS PATIENT FOLDER HOWEVER WAS NOT FOR THE CORRECT PATIENT. SYNAPSE HAS FUNCTIONALITY DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THIS TYPE OF EVENT. WHEN STUDIES ARE RECEIVED FROM A MODALITY, SYNAPSE PULLS THE PATIENT INFORMATION FROM THE DICOM HEADER. SYNAPSE THEN TRIES TO MATCH THE PATIENT INFORMATION, E.G., THE PATIENT ID, PATIENT NAME, ETC. WITH THE ACCESSION NUMBER. WHEN SYNAPSE FINDS A POSSIBLE MISMATCH IT CREATES AN ANOMALY ALERT. ANYTIME THE EXAM IS OPENED AN ANOMALY ALERT WILL OPEN ON THE USER'S MONITOR SCREEN INDICATING THAT AN ANOMALY EXISTS FOR THIS EXAM. THE ANOMALY ALERT IDENTIFIED IN THE EVENT ABOVE WOULD INDICATE MISMATCH PATIENT NAME." A SCREENSHOT OF AN ANOMALY ALERT IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR REFERENCE (THIS IS NOT FROM THE PARTICULAR EVENT).

5059465	1	THE (B)(6) STATE PUBLIC HEALTH NEWBORN SCREENING LABORATORY USES THE PERKINELMER SCREENING CENTER MODULE OF SPECIMEN GATE (SGSC) SOFTWARE (A CLASS I MEDICAL DEVICE) TO STORE, RETRIEVE, AND PROCESS THE DATA ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIMEN TESTING INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, TESTS ORDERED, TEST RESULTS, TEST RESULT INTERPRETATION, QUALITY CONTROL RESULTS, AND RESULT CODES (FLAGS) THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPECIMEN FROM ITS ENTRY INTO THE LABORATORY WORKFLOW UNTIL PATIENT REPORT IS GENERATED AND RELEASED. WHEN SGSC SOFTWARE IS INSTALLED, CONFIGURABLE SETTINGS ARE PROGRAMMED BASED ON THE CUSTOMER PREFERENCES. FOR INSTANCE, EACH LABORATORY ENTERS THEIR SPECIFIC POPULATION BASED REFERENCE RANGES THAT ARE USED TO EVALUATE IF A PATIENT'S TEST RESULTS ARE NORMAL, BELOW OR ABOVE THE REFERENCE RANGE AND REQUIRE FURTHER ACTION SUCH AS REPEAT TESTING. THIS LABORATORY SPECIFIC LOGIC AUTOMATES THE FLOW OF THE SPECIMEN THROUGH THE LABORATORY. THE CUSTOMER DEFINES THE NOMENCLATURE USED FOR THEIR RESULT CODES (FLAGS), AND WHEN THE SOFTWARE ENCOUNTERS THE PREDEFINED RESULT CODE THE SOFTWARE PROCESSES THE SPECIMEN ACCORDING TO THE LOGIC ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESULT CODE. THE NEWBORN SCREENING LABORATORY RECEIVED 3 SPECIMENS FOR THE PATIENT. BY PROTOCOL, TWO SPECIMENS SHOULD BE SENT FOR ALL BABIES BORN IN (B)(6). THE FIRST SPECIMEN WAS RECEIVED ON 1/02/2015. THE INITIAL MET WAS PANIC HIGH, TRIGGERING A CONFIRMATION REQUEST. THE CONFIRMATION WAS NOT TESTED BY THE LABORATORY, BUT THE CONFIRMATION RECORD WAS ATTACHED TO A SEPARATE ASSAY THAT THE SPECIMEN WAS NOT PUNCHED TO, CAUSING INCOMPLETE RESULTS FOR THE CONFIRMATION HCY (HOMOCYSTINURIA) SO THE LABORATORY WAS UNABLE TO PRINT THE REPORT AND CONTACTED PERKINELMER FOR ASSISTANCE. PERKINELMER CANCELLED AND UNATTACHED THE RECORDS THAT WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPARATE ASSAY. A REVIEW ITEM WAS CREATED FOR THIS SPECIMEN ON (B)(6) 2015 AT 10:45 AM PREVENTING THE REPORT FROM BEING PRINTED. THE LABORATORY CLOSED THE REVIEW ITEM ON 01/08/2015 AT 11:25 AM ALLOWING THE REPORT TO BE PRINTED, DISPLAYING NORMAL FOR THE HCY DISORDER EVEN THOUGH TESTING NEEDED TO BE CONFIRMED. THE SECOND SPECIMEN WAS RECEIVED ON 01/05/2015, ANALYZED AND REPORTED AS NORMAL FOR HCY DISORDER ON 1/07/2015. THE THIRD SPECIMEN WAS RECEIVED ON 01/30/2015, ANALYZED AND REPORTED AS NORMAL FOR HCY DISORDER ON 2/03/2015. THE PATIENT REPORT RELEASED DID NOT CONTAIN ANY ERRONEOUS CONTENT. (B)(4).

2380645	0	A CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT A CELL IN THEIR BACT/ALERT INSTRUMENT FAILED QC. WHILE INSPECTING THE CELL, THE CUSTOMER FOUND THE LOADED BOTTLE HAD CRACKED AND THE CONTENTS HAD LEAKED INTO THE CELL. ERROR CODE 60 "CELL FAILED QC" ALERTED THE CUSTOMER THAT THE CELL HAD MALFUNCTIONED. THE BACT/ALERT USER MANUAL INSTRUCTS THE USER TO IDENTIFY THE FAILED CELL, INSPECT THE CELL FOR DEBRIS AND REMOVE OR CLEAN IF NECESSARY, AND THEN TO RECALIBRATE THE CELL. THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT WEARING GLOVES WHILE PERFORMING THE QC CHECK AND WAS REQUIRED TO FILL OUT AN INCIDENT REPORT FOLLOWING THE HOSPITAL/LAB PROTOCOL. THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND PROCEDURES SECTION IN THE BACT/ALERT USER MANUAL CONTAINS GENERAL PRECAUTIONS THAT RECOMMEND: "THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE OBSERVED DURING MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE A SPILL IS NEITHER OBSERVED NO SUSPECTED. AT A MINIMUM, DISPOSABLE GLOVES, EYE PROTECTION, AND A LABORATORY COAT SHOULD BE WORN." THE BACT/ALERT 3D SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO LIMIT THE EFFECTS OF LEAKS AS THE USER MANUAL STATES: "EACH BOTTLE CELL WITHIN THE BACT/ALERT 3D INCUBATION MODULE IS SEALED TO HELP CONTAIN AND MINIMIZE EFFECTS OF LIQUID SPILLAGE." THE USER MANUAL ALSO REFERS THE CUSTOMER TO FOLLOW THE CLSI GUIDELINE M-29A "PROTECTION OF LABORATORY WORKERS FROM INSTRUMENT BIOHAZARDS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE TRANSMITTED BY BLOOD, BODY FLUIDS, AND TISSUE." THE CUSTOMER IS UNSURE WHETHER THE BOTTLE WAS DROPPED OR IF THE PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEM WAS USED TO TRANSPORT THIS BOTTLE IN THEIR FACILITY. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THE CRACK WAS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE. ALTHOUGH, THE CUSTOMER REPORT NO INJURY, THEY DID REPORT THE HEALTHCARE WORKER WHO CHECKED THE FAILED QC CELL SOUTH MEDICAL TREATMENT, PER THEIR LABORATORY PROCEDURE, TO PRECLUDE EXPOSURE TO THE BOTTLE CONTENTS. THE HEALTHCARE WORKER HAD TESTS FOR HCAB, HBAG AND HIVSC, AND ALL RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. THE CUSTOMER IS NOT WILLING TO DISCLOSE ANY ADDITIONAL INFO ABOUT THE HEALTHCARE WORKER'S TESTS, AND THE CUSTOMER IS NOT ABLE TO DISCLOSE WHAT MICROORGANISM THE PATIENT WAS BEING TESTED FOR BECAUSE, THE SAMPLE WAS RECEIVED FROM ANOTHER HOSPITAL AND THE INFO IS PROTECTED BY HIPAA REGULATIONS. AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN OPENED TO EXAMINE THE BOTTLE CRACK. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER BOTTLE BREAKS FOR THIS LOT. AS THERE ARE NO SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH THIS LOT, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THIS ISSUE WILL RECUR. THIS EVENT IS REPORTABLE TO THE FDA AS AN ADVERSE EVENT BECAUSE, THE CUSTOMER HAS TO SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT TO DETERMINE EXPOSURE TO THE INOCULATED BOTTLE MEDIA. NO REPORT OF MEDICAL INJURY HAS BEEN RECORDED AT THIS TIME.

A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.><INVESTIGATION OF THE ECG WAVEFORMS FROM SINGLE LEAD (12-LEAD WAVEFORMS NOT AVAILABLE) WAS CONDUCTED. CONCLUSION WAS THAT THERE ARE HEART RATE (HR) INCREASES DUE TO ARTIFACTS, HOWEVER, THE HR INCREASES ARE INTERMITTENT AND SOME OF THE HR INCREASES WERE SEEN ALSO IN THE PLETH WAVEFORM SUGGESTING PERFUSION. THE B850 LOGS FROM (B)(6) 2014 19:01:18 TO (B)(6) 2014 18:32:32 SHOW EIGHT (8) HR HIGH ( TACHY) ALARMS WITH LONGEST DURATION OF 6 SECONDS WITH THE HR HIGH ALARM LIMIT OF 200 /MIN. THIS INDICATES THAT THE HR WAS BELOW ALARM LIMIT MOST OF THE TIME. THE INVOLVED PDM MODULE WAS TESTED FOR LINEARITY, DYNAMIC RANGE, AND NOISE PERFORMANCE, PASSED ALL TESTS AND NO ISSUES WERE FOUND. THE INVOLVED ECG CABLE WAS REQUESTED FOR INVESTIGATION BUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE. GE ENGINEERS VISITED THE REPORTING HOSPITAL. THEY WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ECG ELECTRODES WERE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ARTIFACT SEEN IN THE ECG WAVEFORM. AFTER THE CUSTOMER CHANGED TO A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURED ECG ELECTRODE, THE NOISE ARTIFACT NO LONGER EXISTED AND FALSE ARRHYTHMIA CALLS STOPPED. NO FURTHER COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED OF THIS ISSUE FROM THE CUSTOMER SINCE THE CHANGE OF THE ECG ELECTRODES. THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE ISSUE WAS CAUSED BY THE COMBINATION OF HIGH SKIN-TO-ELECTRODE IMPEDANCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE. THE ECG MEASUREMENT CIRCUITRY WILL BE MORE SENSITIVE TO EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE IF THE ECG ELECTRODE IMPEDANCE IS HIGH. THE B850 USER'S MANUAL COVERS SKIN PREPARATION TECHNIQUES: SHAVE ANY HAIR FROM THE ELECTRODE SITE; GENTLY RUB THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN TO INCREASE CAPILLARY BLOOD FLOW; CLEAN THE SKIN WITH ALCOHOL OR MILD SOAP AND WATER SOLUTION TO REMOVE SKIN OIL AND DEAD OR ABRADED SKIN CELLS; DRY THE SKIN COMPLETELY BEFORE APPLYING THE ELECTRODES. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE SECTION ON SKIN PREPARATION WAS NOT FOLLOWED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE B850 USER'S MANUAL (2062971-001) COVERS TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES. FOR NOISY ECG SIGNAL THE ECG TROUBLESHOOTING GIVES THE FOLLOWING SOLUTION: CHECK THE ELECTRODE QUALITY AND POSITIONING. DO NOT PLACE ELECTRODES ON BODY HAIR

2446443	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PT INFO IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT#: (B)(4). THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. ROOT CAUSE: THE RDF ANALYSIS DID NOT FIND A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE OF THE ELEVATED WBC CONTENT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. SIGNALS IN THE RDF INDICATE IT IS POSSIBLE, THOUGH NOT CONCLUSIVE, THAT THE PLASMA LINE MAY HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OCCLUDED NEAR THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. IF THE PLASMA LINE DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE PROPERLY TO THE PLATELET PUMP, IT COULD CAUSE THE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SYS EXPECTS, POSSIBLY ALLOWING SOME WBC'S TO ESCAPE. ORIENTATION OF THE HEX IN THE HEX HOLDER MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ABOVE. THE PLASMA LINE MAY BECOME OCCLUDED IF THE CENTRIFUGE COLLAR IS NOT LOADED INTO THE LATCH IN THE CORRECT ORIENTATION. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE RBC LINE IS ALLOWED TO LIE ON TOP OF THE PLASMA LINE AND, UNDER CERTAIN FLOW CONDITIONS, MAY CAUSE THE PLASMA LINE TO PINCH OFF. THIS IN TURN CAUSES HIGHER FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ELEVATED LEVELS OF WBC'S IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. CORRECTIVE/PREVENTIVE ACTION: ALGORITHMS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SOFTWARE FOR THE TRIMA ACCEL SYS. THESE ALGORITHMS WILL RECOGNIZE A POTENTIAL ELEVATED WBC COUNT DUE TO THE FAILURE MODE WITNESSED DURING THIS INVESTIGATION. THE SOFTWARE WILL FLAG THE PROCEDURE TO MEASURE OR VERIFY WBC'S IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT.

EVALUATION: UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM CORROSION WHICH CAN FURTHER DEVELOP INTO AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. THE COPPER PRESENT IN THE GROUND STRAP WAS EXPOSED TO SODIUM AZIDE FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME TO FORM CORROSION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. INDEPENDENT STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS FOUND ON FIELD RETURNED GROUND STRAPS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COPPER AZIDE DEPOSITS, FORMATION RATES OF COPPER AZIDE, THE FEASIBILITY OF STAINLESS STEEL AS A POTENTIAL GROUND STRAP MATERIAL AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. ONE STUDY REVEALED THERE ARE OTHER METALS, POTENTIALLY UTILIZED IN INSTRUMENT DESIGNS, THAT MAY FORM AN UNSTABLE AZIDE COMPOUND ARE GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, BRASS AND TIN. (B)(4) PERFORMED A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF STEEL AND TIN AS REPLACEMENT FOR COPPER. THE STUDY INDICATED THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXPLOSIVE AZIDES FORMED IF STEEL, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NICKEL AND CHROMIUM, COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BUFFER SOLUTION. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM AZIDE WAS CONDUCTED. OTHER PARTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING COPPER WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER MATERIAL WITH NO KNOWN POTENTIAL VOLATILE METAL FORMATIONS. INSTRUMENT DESIGNS WILL AVOID THE USE OF BARE COPPER OR TIN COATED COPPER IN AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO SODIUM AZIDE MIGHT BE EXPECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. THE MATERIAL OF THE GROUND STRAP WAS CHANGED TO A (B)(4). A MANDATORY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN REQUIRED THAT EVERY COPPER GROUND STRAP BE REPLACED BY FIELD SERVICE TO THE (B)(4). IN ADDITION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A (B)(4) WZ MECHANISM GROUND STRAP, INSTRUCTIONS ON THE REMOVAL AND PACKAGING OF POTENTIALLY CORRODED GROUP STRAPS WERE INCORPORATED INTO LABELING. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING FROM (B)(4) 2009 TO (B)(4) 2010 INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS WITH RESPECT TO CORROSION OR ADVERSE EVENTS IN CONJUNCTIONS WITH THE REPLACEMENT STAINLESS STEEL ARCHITECT WASH ZONE MECHANISM GROUND STRAP. PRODUCT LABELING WAS REVIEWED AND FOUND TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS INVOLVED WITH PRODUCTS CONTAINING SODIUM AZIDE; HOWEVER, LABELING WAS ENHANCED TO INCLUDE REFERENCE TO NIOSH, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH. >< WHILE PERFORMING THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN, THE FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE OBSERVED CORROSION ON THE ARCHITECT WASH ZONE GROUND STRAP.

THE UNIT WAS THEN TESTED WHILE SWITCHED OFF AND WHILE SWITCHED ON, BOTH ON MAINS AND BATTERY POWER. NO FAILURES WERE OBSERVED. THE REPORTED ISSUE COULD NOT BE REPLICATED. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE KEYPAD, LOW VOLTAGE AND MINIMAL CURRENT OF THE DEVICE, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE UNIT'S KEYPAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE PT BURN. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED EVENT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, THE UNIT WAS REPLACED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE.

3185675	1	IT WAS REPORTED TO HEALTHCARE-ID (HID) BY (B)(4) THAT ON 10 OCCASIONS SINCE (B)(6) 2012, FOR DONORS USING THE INTERNET COMPUTER ASSISTED SELF INTERVIEW (ICASI) OF DONOR-ID (B)(4), IT APPEARS THAT THE RESPONSES TO THE FIRST ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN OMITTED AND THE RESPONSES HAVE SHIFTED TO BE APPLIED TO THE INCORRECT QUESTIONS. ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION A DONOR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEFERRED WAS COLLECTED. THE OCCURRENCES WERE RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE DONOR CENTER. THE METHOD USED BY (B)(4) FOR ICASI PUTS THREE BARCODES ON THE DONOR RECEIPT THAT IS PRINTED AND BROUGHT BY THE DOCTOR TO THE COLLECTION SITE. BARCODE SCANNERS AT (B)(4) ARE PROGRAMMED TO INSERT AND AUTOMATIC "ENTER" AT THE END OF THE BARCODE READ SO THAT STAFF USERS DO NOT HAVE TO CLICK THE ENTER KEY ON THE SCREEN AFTER THE SCAN. INFO RECEIVED FROM (B)(4) WAS THAT THESE DONORS ALL CLAIMED TO HAVE COMPLETED THE ENTIRE QUESTIONNAIRE DURING THE ICASI PROCESS. STAFF USERS HAVE ROUTINELY BEEN OBSERVED SCANNING THE THREE BARCODES IN RAPID SUCCESSION. ALTHOUGH THIS IS DUE TO USER ERROR, WE HAVE INITIATED INVESTIGATION INTO A CHECK AGAINST THE USER MAKING THIS ERROR TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN A FUTURE VERSION OF THE DONOR-ID WEB SOFTWARE. CONCLUSION: WHEN THE SOFTWARE IS USED AS INTENDED, IT WORKS PROPERLY. IN EVERY INSTANCE WHERE THE USER IS KNOWN TO WAIT FOR THE PROMPT TO SCAN THE BARCODE THE ENTIRE BARCODE IS REGISTERED IN THE DATABASE AND THERE ARE NO MISMATCHED RESPONSES. BLOOD CENTER USERS MUST FOLLOW THE ON-SCREEN PROMPTS FOR TIMING OF BARCODE SCANS FROM THE ICASI RECEIPT. IN THOSE CASES WHEN THE BARCODE IS SCANNED TOO SOON INCOMPLETE DATA MAY BE RECEIVED AND THERE ARE AMPLE INDICATIONS THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS WITH THE RESPONSE RECORDED. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED IN THE CONTINUED INVESTIGATION SECTION, WHEN THE RESPONSES ARE SHIFTED IN ORDER, THE USER MUST TAKE ACTION ON FOUR SEPARATE LEVELS FOR THE DONOR'S RESPONSES. ANY ONE OF THESE SHOULD BE A CAUSE FOR THE USER TO QUESTION WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND GIVE THOUGHT TO REJECTING THE ENTIRE SET OF RESPONSES. FOR THE CASES SENT TO HID FOR INVESTIGATION THE USER WOULD HAVE HAD ALL FOUR OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO DEAL WITH. ADDITIONALLY, THE DISCREPANCIES ARE ALSO NOT BEING CAUGHT DURING REVIEW WHICH CAN OCCUR ON-SCREEN OR FROM THE PRINTED DONOR RECORD. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS ISSUE. WHEN THE NETWORK OR SERVER RUN SLOWLY, THE PROCESSING OF THE BARCODES TAKES LONGER WHICH INCREASES THE CHANCE THAT THE USER WILL ATTEMPT TO SCAN THE BARCODE TOO SOON (PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE PROMPT THAT THE NEXT SCAN CAN BE PERFORMED). THE BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMER HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PROCESSING TAKES PLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER.

I ASKED CALLER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VOLUME WASN'T MUTED OR TURNED ALL THE WAY DOWN ON THE DESKTOP. SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD ALREADY CHECKED IT AND THE VOLUME WAS TURNED ALL THE WAY UP. I CAME IN TO FIND THAT THE AUDIO CABLE FOR THE OBIX ALARM HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM THE DISPLAY. SINCE THE SPEAKERS ARE BUILT INTO THE DISPLAY THE AUDIO ALARM WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WITH THE CABLE DISCONNECTED. I PLUGGED THE AUDIO CABLE BACK INTO THE DISPLAY AND CONFIRMED THAT THE AUDIO ALARM IS NOW SOUNDING. THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THAT THIS CABLE WAS FOUND DISCONNECTED. THE DISPLAY THAT THE AUDIO CABLE PLUGS INTO IS STATIONARY AND THE AUDIO CABLE ITSELF IS PLUGGED IN AT THE REAR OF THE DISPLAY MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTALLY UNPLUGGED. I SUSPECT THAT USERS ARE DISCONNECTING THE CABLE TO SILENCE THE AUDIO ALARM. THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF ALARM FATIGUE WHERE THE ALARMS ARE SO FREQUENT AND DISRUPTIVE THAT USERS INTENTIONALLY DEFEAT THE ALARM AUDIO.

SEVERAL ATTEMPTS OF THIS WERE MADE AND THEY ALL FAILED, SO THE  OPTICAL TRACKING WAS TERMINATED AND THE CASE AND PLACING OF PEDICLE SCREWS WAS PERFORMED BY C-ARM GUIDANCE. THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS OTHER THAN THE FAILURE OF THE O-ARM TO SEND SIGNALS TO THE STEALTH SYSTEM.FOLLOW UP ACTION: PER HOSPITAL'S BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER: THERE ARE USER CALIBRATIONS THAT NEED TO BE DONE INCLUDING A MOTION TEST. THE USERS WERE NOT AWARE OF THE NEED TO PERFORM THE MOTION TEST. IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE BIOMED DEPT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING THE CALIBRATIONS EVERY 30 DAYS AND THIS TESTING WILL INCLUDE PERFORMING THE MOTION TEST.

3840183	1	ORDERING IV FLUIDS IS A COMPLEX TASK ON THE CPE DEVICE. THE ORDERING SCREENS ARE NOISY AND SEEK MUCH IRRELEVANT INFORMATION WHICH SERVES TO DISTRACT AND CONFUSE THE USE AND THE TASK AT HAND. THE DIFFICULTY IN NAVIGATING THE ORDERING SCREENS RESULTS IN CLINICALLY COUNTER INTUITIVE INFUSIONS. THIS PATIENT WITH SEPSIS, HYPOTENSION, AND TACHYCARDIA WAS ORDERED FLUIDS AT 125 CC PER HOUR IN THE EMERGENCY WARD. LATER IN THE DAY, THE PATIENT BECAME HYPOTENSIVE AND TACHYCARDIC WITH A SPIKE OF FEVER. WHAT WAS NOT KNOWN BY THE CLINICAL TEAM WAS THAT IN THE TINY FONT OF THAT IV FLUID ORDER WAS THAT THE IV FLUIDS WERE TO STOP AUTOMATICALLY AFTER 3 LITRES. THE NURSES STOPPED THE FLUID DESPITE THE SEPSIS, BECAUSE THE CPOE DEVICE REQUIRED THAT, AND THERE WAS NOT ANY NOTIFICATION OR CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT WARNING OF SAME. THE IV FLUIDS WERE RESTARTED AFTER THE DETERIORATION THAT REQUIRED TRANSFER TO ICU. THE STEALTH CESSATION OF DISEASE CRITICAL FLUID WAS LIFE THREATENING. THE COMPLEXITIES AND POOR USABILITY OF THE IV FLUID ORDER MERIT INVESTIGATION, SURVEILLANCE AND POSSIBLE RECALL.
3089758	0	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED AN ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE DOUBLE PLATELET PRODUCT AT THEIR (B)(6) SITE. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS.  A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.><INVESTIGATION: THE CUSTOMER DID NOT PROVIDE THE LOT NUMBER PERTAINING TO THIS EVENT,THEREFORE A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) SEARCH COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED FOR THIS SPECIFIC INCIDENT. ALL LOTS MUST MEET ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA BEFORE RELEASE. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED ELEVATED WBC DATA FOR MULTIPLE PROCEDURES. THE DATA FOR THESE PROCEDURAL EVENTS WAS ANALYZED AS A GROUPING. INVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE RUN DATA FILES (RDFS)IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PROCEDURAL EVENTS, AS LISTED BELOW, THAT MAY HAVE LED TO ELEVATED WBC LEVELS IN COLLECTED PRODUCT. ROOT CAUSE: RDFS FOR THE PROCEDURES WITH HIGH RWBC WERE RECEIVED, INVESTIGATED AND ANALYZED. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVENTS THAT LED TO ELEVATED WBC CONTENT IN PLATELET PRODUCTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND ARE AS FOLLOWS: PRE-PURGE SATURATIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT THE LRS CHAMBER HAS REACHED ITS WBC HOLDING CAPACITY BEFORE EXPECTED BY THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. POST-PURGE SATURATIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT AFTER AN LRS PURGE, THE LRS CHAMBER HAS RE-FILLED WITH WBCS BEFORE EXPECTED BY THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. PLASMA LINE OCCLUSIONS - SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT THE PLASMA LINE WAS PARTIALLY OCCLUDED DURING A PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE. THIS CAN CAUSE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, DECREASING THE HOLDING CAPACITY OF THE LRS CHAMBER. OTHER EVENTS - THESE CAN INCLUDE; CENTRIFUGE STOPS, MULTIPLE ACCESS ALARMS & FLOW ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A NON STEADY STATE CHAMBER CONDITIONS, AND RBC SPILLOVER SWITCH CAN POSSIBLY LEAD TO A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT. ALSO INCLUDED ARE DONOR RELATED CHARACTERISTICS. CORRECTION: A TRIMA SOFTWARE VERSION UPGRADE HAS BEEN COMPLETED AT ALL OF THE CUSTOMER¿S CENTERS. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED DATA GATHERED FROM A TERUMO BCT RECOMMENDED TRIAL OF AVERAGING THE LAST 3 PLATELET COUNTS OF DONORS. THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT USING THE AVERAGE PLATELET COUNT SHOWED A MORE CONSISTENT PROCESS, WHICH WILL REDUCE VARIATION SHOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS RWBC FAILURES.

1887064	0	THE ALTERNATE INSTRUMENT'S IMAGE ANALYSIS MEASUREMENTS (IAM) WAS SUGGESTIVE OF A WEAK REACTION AS THE SPC IS NEAR THE THRESHOLD LOW SETTING. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION BCI WAS INFORMED BY THE CUSTOMER TECHNICAL SUPPORT (CTS) THAT THE DONOR UNIT WAS TYPED MANUALLY AS C POSITIVE. A REVIEW OF ALL BCI COMPLAINT RECORDS, IN RELEVANCE TO THIS EVENT, DID NOT REVEAL ANY OTHER REPORTS OF FALSE NEGATIVE RESULTS. NO EVIDENCE OF ANALYZER MALFUNCTION WAS OBSERVED IN TEST DATA PROVIDED. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT IS UNDETERMINED. >< A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BECKMAN COULTER INC. (BCI) IN REGARDS TO OBTAINING A BLOOD SAMPLE RESULT TYPED AS 'C NEGATIVE' ON THE PK7300 AUTOMATED MICROPLATE SYSTEM. THE BLOOD DONOR HAD PREVIOUSLY TESTED AS 'C POSITIVE' BY AN ALTERNATE INSTRUMENT IN 2009. THE ERRONEOUS RESULT WAS REPORTED OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY BUT A CORRECTED REPORT WAS AMENDED, WHICH WAS TYPED MANUALLY AS 'C POSITIVE.' NO PATIENTS WERE HARMED IN THIS INCIDENT. CUSTOMER TECHNICAL SUPPORT (CTS) CONFIRMED THAT THE DONOR UNIT WAS NOT TRANSFUSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FILLING AN ORDER FOR 'C NEGATIVE' BLOOD.
1036329	0	THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT THE AXSYM ANALYZER IS GENERATING ERROR CODE 3550: SYS PRESSURE LIMIT EXCEEDED, SOLN 4. DURING TROUBLESHOOTING FOR THIS ISSUE, SMOKE BEGAN COMING FROM THE ANALYZER'S SYRINGE MOTOR. THE ABBOTT CUSTOMER TECHNICAL ADVOCATE ADVISED THE CUSTOMER TO SHUTDOWN/POWER OFF THE ANALYZER AND INITIATED A SERVICE CALL. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF INJURY OR DAMAGE TO THE SURROUNDING LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT. THERE IS NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT REPORTED. >< AN ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE REP (FSR) REPLACED THE PRESSURE MONITOR PCB, THE SAMPLE SYRINGE AND THE PRESSURE MONITOR SENSOR. THE FSR THEN PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING VERIFICATION PROCEDURES: VP03 STARTUP, VP47 FLUSH, VP49 FLUIDICS, VP06 TEAH CLEANING, VP22 P-PROBE CAL, VP25 S-PROBE CAL, VP55 TOUCH SCREEN CAL AND A PRESSURE MONITOR CHECK. THE AXSYM ANALYZER MET ALL SPECIFICATIONS. NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED AND NO PT RESULTS WERE IMPACTED. NO CAUSE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE REPORT OF SMOKE. THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE IS ADDRESSED IN THE ABBOTT AXSYM SYSTEM SOFTWARE VERSION 5.20 ADDENDUM: MARCH 2005 SOFTWARE VERSION 5.20 ADDENDUM: PRESSURE MONITORING 3550 SYSTEM PRESSURE LIMIT EXCEEDED, SOLUTION 4. PROBABLE CAUSE: MALFUNCTION OF PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM. THIS IS A FINAL REPORT.
1624743	1	NO MISADMINISTRATION WAS REPORTED IN THIS CASE. THIS ISSUE IS A KNOWN MALFUNCTION, AND APPEARS TO BE A DISPLAY ONLY PROBLEM. IN PREVIOUS REPORTS, WHEN THE MLC SETTINGS HAVE BEEN PHYSICALLY EXAMINED, THEY HAVE BEEN CORRECT. NO MISADMINISTRATION HAS EVER BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THIS MALFUNCTION. THE 'ORANGE LEAF' DISPLAY AT THE 4D TREAT CONSOLE, HOWEVER, IS INTENDED TO ALERT THE USER THAT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE MLC LOCATION AND THEREFORE ACTS AS A SAFETY MECHANISM TO HELP PREVENT MISADMINISTRATION. THIS SAFETY MECHANISM HAS FAILED IN THIS MALFUNCTION, WHICH INTRODUCES THE POSSIBILITY FOR MISTREATMENT SHOULD THERE ACTUALLY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE MLC, BUT THE OPERATOR CHOOSES TO IGNORE THE INDICATION DUE TO PRIOR FALSE POSITIVE REPORTS. NO FURTHER FOLLOW-UP TO THIS MDR IS EXPECTED. >< THE USER REPORTED THAT DURING PATIENT TREATMENT, THE 4D TREAT WORKSTATION INDICATED THE MULTI LEAF COLLIMATOR (MLC) LEAVES HAD NOT MOVED INTO POSITION FOR THE NEXT FIELD. THERE WAS NO INTERLOCK TO STOP THEM FROM TREATING WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN INCORRECT MLC SHAPE. NO PATIENT INJURY REPORTED, AND NO PATIENT DATA PROVIDED.
1958050	0	A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BECKMAN COULTER INC., (BCI) REGARDING PATIENT RESULTS GENERATED BY THE COULTER ACT DIFF 2 ANALYZER THAT DID NOT MATCH RESULTS OBTAINED AT THE HOSPITAL. IT IS UNKNOWN WHAT PARAMETERS WERE AFFECTED OR THE EXACT DATE THE ERRONEOUS RESULTS WERE GENERATED. ERRONEOUS RESULTS WERE REPORTED OUTSIDE THE LAB. THE PATIENT SPECIMEN WAS SENT TO A REFERENCE LAB AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO PATIENT TREATMENT. A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS DISPATCHED: THE FSE RAN QC REPRODUCIBILITY AND CARRY OVER AND OBTAINED GOOD RESULTS. THE FSE VERIFIED INSTRUMENT OPERATIONS; RESULTS MEET PUBLISHED PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS. A CLEAR ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED TO DATE.

A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE EVALUATION IS COMPLETE.><THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED SMOKE COMING FROM THE CELL-DYN RUBY ANALYZER. THE CUSTOMER ALSO INDICATED THAT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM WAS NOISY. THERE WAS NO INJURY TO THE INSTRUMENT OPERATOR OR IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED.><FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMER ISSUE INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT TEXT, ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE EVALUATION, A SEARCH FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, AND A REVIEW OF LABELING. ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE REPLACED THE POWER SUPPLY AND RESOLVED THE ISSUE. TRACKING AND TRENDING DID NOT IDENTIFY AN ADVERSE TREND. LABELING WAS REVIEWED AND FOUND TO BE ADEQUATE FOR POWER SPECIFICATIONS AND ELECTRICAL HAZARDS. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION NO PRODUCT DEFICIENCY OF THE CELL-DYN RUBY ANALYZER, LIST NUMBER 08H67 WAS IDENTIFIED.
2883756	0	REPORTER STATED THAT A PATIENT SAMPLE WAS TESTED ON THE SUSPECT URISYS 1100 WHICH PRODUCED A FALSE NEGATIVE RESULT FOR PROTEIN. AN ADDITIONAL TEST WAS REPORTEDLY PERFORMED, USING THE SAME STRIP LOT, ON A DIFFERENT URISYS INSTRUMENT WHICH REPORTED A PROTEIN RESULT OF 500 MG/DL. NO ADVERSE EVENT WAS REPORTED. THE MANUFACTURER REQUESTED THE RETURN OF THE SUSPECT PRODUCT FOR EVALUATION. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE INITIAL REPORTER HAS REPORTED OR INTENDS TO REPORT THE EVENT TO F.D.A.
2992654	0	A CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT GALILEO ECHO (B)(4) ASSIGNED THE INCORRECT SAMPLE IDENTIFIER TO A PATIENT SAMPLE. A REVIEW OF THE RESULT FILES SHOWED THAT REACTIONS APPEARED AS REPORTED BY THE ECHO FOR EACH SAMPLE. ON (B)(4) 2013, SAMPLES WERE RECEIVED FROM THE CUSTOMER. A REVIEW OF SAMPLE BARCODE LABELS DID NOT SHOW ANY ARTIFACTS OR PRINT QUALITY ISSUES. THE TUBES WERE PLACED IN A SAMPLE RACK AND LOADED ONTO THE ECHO. THE BARCODE FOR SAMPLE TUBE 069526 WAS SEATED LOW IN THE SAMPLE RACK. THERE WAS MINIMAL WHITE SPACE BETWEEN THE BARCODE AND THE SAMPLE RACK. AS PART OF THE INSTALLATION PROCESS, CUSTOMERS ARE ASKED TO SEND IN EXAMPLES OF THEIR BARCODE LABELS TO DETERMINE THE BARCODE SYMBOLOGY AND IF ANY CONFIGURATIONS ARE NEEDED FOR THE ECHO TO READ THE BARCODES. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED EXAMPLES OF THEIR BARCODES AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BARCODE SYMBOLOGY WAS CODE 39 WITHOUT CHECK DIGITS. CUSTOMERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE RECOMMENDED CORRECTION IS IMPLEMENTATION OF CHECK DIGITS IN THE CODE 39 BARCODES. A CHECK DIGIT IS A NUMERIC DIGIT USED TO ENSURE THAT A BARCODE NUMBER IS ENTERED ACCURATELY INTO THE COMPUTER. THE LABEL POSITION IN CONJUNCTION WITH HAVING CODE 39 BARCODES WITHOUT CHECK DIGITS ARE POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE MISREAD SAMPLE ID.
2181932	1	THIS X-RAY SYSTEM WILL INTERMITTENTLY EXPORT FLIPPED IMAGES TO THE PICTURE ARCHIVING COMPUTER SYSTEM (PACS). THESE FLIPPED IMAGES REFERS TO IMAGE INVERSION AND CAN BE DESCRIBED AS "MIRRORED" WHERE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARE REVERSED. INVERTED WOULD APPLY TO THE TOP AND BOTTOM BEING REVERSED. THE RANDOM CHANGES IN THE IMAGE ORIENTATION COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF THE FOUR POSSIBLE ORIENTATION ERRORS. A REBOOT OF THE SYSTEM WILL TEMPORALLY RESTORE NORMAL OPERATION. (CONCLUSIONS): THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS A SOFTWARE RELATED ISSUE. A FIELD CHANGE ORDER WILL BE RELEASED TO CORRECT THIS SOFTWARE ISSUE.
5136210	1	WE WERE RECENTLY MADE AWARE OF A VIRTUOSO SOFTWARE PRODUCT ISSUE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT PATIENT SAFETY FOR CUSTOMERS USING VERSION 5.4 OR 5.5. THE SOFTWARE SCANS SLIDES AT 4X,10X, 20X, OR 40X MAGNIFICATIONS. FOR IMAGES SCANNED AT 4X, 10X, AND 40X MAGNIFICATION, THE LINEAR AND AREA MEASUREMENT TOOLS DISPLAY A VALUE THAT IS 1/5, ½ AND 2X THE ACTUAL MEASUREMENT, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEASUREMENT WILL BE DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAGNIFICATION YOU ARE VIEWING THE IMAGE AT. FOR IMAGES THAT ARE SCANNED AT 20X MAGNIFICATION, THE MEASUREMENT TOOLS WORK PROPERLY IN ALL VERSIONS OF VIRTUOSO INCLUDING VERSIONS 5.4 AND 5.5. FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE EU/EEA AND CANADA WHO USE VIRTUOSO V5.4 AND V5.5 FOR PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS, THE MEASUREMENT TOOLS FOR SLIDES THAT WERE SCANNED AT 4X, 10X, OR 40X, COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE INCORRECT ESTIMATION OF CLINICAL STAGE LEADING TO IMPROPER TREATMENT. MOST PATHOLOGY LABS SCAN AT 20X MAGNIFICATION, WHICH IS NOT IMPACTED BY THIS ERROR. USE OF THE MEASUREMENT TOOL IN THE VIRTUOSO SOFTWARE IS CONSIDERED 'PRIMARY DIGITAL DIAGNOSIS', WHICH IS NOT ON-LABEL IN THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE, US-BASED LABORATORIES SHOULD PERFORM VALIDATION OF THE MEASUREMENT TOOL PRIOR TO USE OF THE SOFTWARE FOR CLINICAL CASES.><CUSTOMER FROM (B)(6) REPORTED WHEN USING SOFTWARE TO SELECT THE SAME AREA IN 2 BIF PICTURES SCANNED AT 20X AND 40X RESPECTIVELY, THE SIZE OF THE SCANNED TISSUE AS REPORTED BY THE SOFTWARE ARE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON SCAN MAGNIFICATION: AT 40X THE SIZE VALUE IS DOUBLE THE REAL SIZE. CLINICAL EVALUATION REGARDING CHANGES IN THERAPEUTIC MANAGEMENT FOR UP TO 18 PATIENTS HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED; HOWEVER EARLY INFORMATION SPECIFIES CHANGES IN T OR N STAGING, LEADING TO VARIATIONS IN ASSESSING PROGNOSIS. MICROSCOPIC TUMOR MEASUREMENTS ARE MOST DIRECTLY TIED TO PATIENT STAGING AND THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF MELANOMA.

THE CUSTOMER CONTINUED TO RUN THE INSTRUMENT IN OPEN MODE WITH NO FURTHER LEAKS. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ANY PATIENT RESULTS BEING AFFECTED BY THIS INCIDENT. THE USER WAS WEARING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) CONSISTING OF GLOVES AND A LAB COAT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS NOT SOUGHT. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF EXPOSURE TO MUCOUS MEMBRANES OR OPEN WOUNDS. A BEC FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS DISPATCHED ON (B)(6) 2011 FOR THIS EVENT. THE FSE INDICATED THAT THE ACTUATOR AT THE PV21 WAS STICKING AND NOT ALLOWING THE BELLOWS TO DRAIN. PV21 OPENS THE PATH FROM THE NEEDLE BELLOWS TO THE WASTE. THE ACTUATOR WAS REPLACED AND REPAIRS WERE VERIFIED PER ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES PRIOR TO RETURNING IT INTO SERVICE. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE LEAK WAS THAT THE ACTUATOR AT PV21 WAS STICKING; THEREFORE, NOT ALLOWING THE BELLOWS TO DRAIN CAUSING THEM TO OVERFLOW AND SPILL. AS PER PRODUCT LABELING, BCI URGES ITS CUSTOMERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL NATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS SUCH AS THE USE OF BARRIER PROTECTION.

BOTH THE NORMAL AND MAGNET MODE OUTPUT CURRENT WAS INCREASED. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED IN THE NOTES THAT THE OFF TIME WAS 180 MINUTES WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1.8 MINUTES. THE FAULTED SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC TEST ON (B)(6) 2009, WHICH WAS OBSERVED IN THE IN-HOUSE DATABASE PREVIOUSLY CAUSED THE PATIENT BEING SET AT UNINTENDED SETTINGS. THE FAULTED DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS WERE MISINTERPRETED FOR THE BATTERY BEING "BURNED OUT." THEREFORE, THE PATIENT WAS REFERRED FOR GENERATOR REPLACEMENT DUE TO SUSPECTED "END OF SERVICE" AS A RESULT WHICH OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2009. THE GENERATOR WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THERE WERE NO PERFORMANCE OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ADVERSE CONDITIONS FOUND WITH THE PULSE GENERATOR. THE PULSE GENERATOR PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS, AND THE DEVICE WAS NOT AT END OF SERVICE. FOLLOW UP WITH THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE ON (B)(6) 2012, REVEALED THAT THE INCREASE IN SEIZURES WAS LIKELY RELATED TO THE PATIENT'S DEVICE NOT BEING AT INTENDED SETTINGS. THE MISINTERPRETATION OF THE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS LED THE PHYSICIAN TO REFER THE PATIENT FOR GENERATOR REPLACEMENT DUE TO END OF SERVICE.><DURING REVIEW OF PROGRAMMING HISTORY AVAILABLE IN THE IN-HOUSE DATABASE, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT A FAULTED SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTIC TEST OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2009 WHICH CHANGED THE PATIENT'S SETTINGS TO UNINTENDED PARAMETERS. THE SETTINGS WERE ALL REPROGRAMMED ON THIS CLINIC VISIT AND A FINAL INTERROGATION WAS PERFORMED, BUT THE OFF TIME WAS INADVERTENTLY NOT CORRECTED TO THE CORRECT PARAMETER. PRIOR TO THE FAULTED TEST, THE OFF TIME WAS SET AT 1.8MIN, AND IT WAS CORRECTED TO 180MIN. AS A RESULT, THE PATIENT WAS NOT RECEIVING EFFICACIOUS SETTINGS. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED.

1055507	0	IN 2005, A DENTAL PRACTICE USED SARGENTI RC2B ROOT CANAL PASTE CONTAINING PARAFORMALDEHYDE, LEAD AND MERCURY DURING A ROOT CANAL ON TOOTH #18. AN OVERFILL OCCURRED INTO MY MANDIBULAR NERVE CHANNEL. MY INFERIOR ALVEOLAR NERVE WAS PERMANENTLY DAMAGED AND SINCE THE DENTISTS FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE OVERFILL, OR THE USE OF SARGENTI PASTE, MY ABILITY TO HAVE THE OVERFILL REMOVED BEFORE PERMANENT, DEBILITATING DAMAGE WAS DONE WAS LOST. SARGENTI PASTE, AKA N2, RC2B, RC2W, ONE STEP ENDODONTIC WHITE, N2 UNIVERSAL, ETC.. HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA AND ON FEB. 12, 1993 WAS DENIED NDA APPROVAL BECAUSE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE MATERIAL HAD NOT BEEN PROVEN -HTTP://WWW.DENTALWATCH.ORG/QUESTIONABLE/ARGENTI/HEARING-1993-.RTF-. I NOW SUFFER FROM PERMANENT NUMBNESS AND DEBILITATING BURNING PAIN IN MY LOWER LEFT LIP, CHIN, AND JAW WHICH REQUIRES EXTENSIVE MEDICATIONS TO REDUCE PAIN. NOTHING ELIMINATES IT; THEREFORE, I AM LEFT WITH 24/7 PAIN AND SUFFERING. ANTI DEPRESSANTS ARE USED TO TREAT THIS CONDITION. THE FDA RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH A WARNING THAT ANTIDEPRESSANTS CAN CAUSE DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS ON PTS, SUCH AS INCREASED SUICIDAL ATTEMPTS. WHY WOULD YOU ALLOW AN ILLEGAL DRUG/DEVICE TO BE USED THAT WHEN DAMAGE OCCURS REQUIRES YET ANOTHER DANGEROUS DRUG TO COUNTERACT? THE PROPONENTS OF SARGENTI PASTE, N2 PRODUCTS, CLAIM THAT RC2B, RC2W ARE GENERICS FOR N2 UNIVERSAL AND THEREFORE, THE GENERICS ARE BEING USED BEFORE THE APPROVAL OF THE NON-GENERIC N2. HOW IS THIS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN? THE AMERICAN ENDODONTIC SOCIETY, WHICH SUPPORTS THE N2 PRODUCTS NDA ACTIVITIES, CLAIMS IN ONE OF THEIR NEWSLETTERS THAT THE FDA HAS APPROVED THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF N2. THIS IS NOT TRUE. WHY CAN THE FDA NOT DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE FALSE ADVERTISING OF THE STATUS OF SARGENTI PASTES? HOW CAN A GENERIC VERSION OF AN UNAPPROVED DRUG BE ALLOWED ON THE MARKET? SMALL COMPOUNDING PHARMACIES ARE MAKING THIS MATERIAL, SELLING IT IN BULK QUANTITIES INTERSTATE AGAINST THE FDA POSITION THAT STATES SHIPMENTS OF 5 GRAMS OR LESS ARE GRANTED A PHARMACY EXEMPTION. THE PHARMACY, WAS SELLING INTERSTATE TO MY DENTISTS IN QUANTITIES OF 6 TIMES THE FDA ALLOWED LIMIT PER A 1991 COMMISSIONER LETTER THAT THE FDA HAS AFFIRMED REMAINS ITS POSITION TODAY. THERE ARE OTHER PHARMACIES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND SELLING ROOT CANAL PASTES WITH PARAFORMALDEHYDE CONTENTS OF 46% AND 98% IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THE FDA NEEDS TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN LAWS AND STOP THE USE OF ANY PARAFORMALDEHYDE CONTAINING ROOT CANAL MATERIALS UNLESS AND UNTIL A NDA IS GRANTED. PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE INJURED BY THIS MATERIAL. DENTISTS CONTINUE TO USE IT IN SECRECY -EVEN AFTER THE PT IS INJURED- BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS BELOW THE STANDARD OF CARE. THE FDA HAS THE JURISDICTION TO STOP THE MFG OF THIS MATERIAL AND SHOULD BE DOING SO. IN 1996, THE. IN 2007, THE FDA IS DOING NOTHING. WHAT HAS CHANGED BETWEEN 1996 AND TODAY THAT HAS MADE THIS DRUG NON-TOXIC AND ACCEPTABLE TO USE? IN 1991, THE FDA ISSUED A WARNING LETTER TO A COMPOUNDING PHARMACY FOR ILLEGALLY ACTING AS A MFG SELLING BULK QUANTITIES ACROSS STATE LINES. HTTP://WWW.CASEWATCH.ORG/FDAWARNING/COMP/SARGENTS.SHTML-. WHY IS IT THAT TODAY NO WARNING LETTERS ARE GENERATED YET THE FDA HAS AFFIRMED THAT THEIR POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED ON THIS MATERIAL SINCE 1991? IN SOME CASES, THE FDA CAN REGULATE DENTISTS FOR USE OF UNAPPROVED DRUGS/DEVICES/ETC.

DOING THIS CLEARED THE MESSAGE AND ALLOWED THE USER TO RETURN TO VENTILATOR MODE, HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM REAPPEARED AFTER A FEW MINUTES.DURING THIS TIME, SEVERAL OTHER VENTILATORS, SOME IN OTHER BUILDINGS, REPORTED THE SAME PROBLEM. IT WAS QUICKLY LEARNED THAT PICIS SYSTEM (EMR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD INTERFACES WITH AESTIVA AND OTHER PATIENT MONITORING EQUIPMENT) HAD A SOFTWARE UPDATE (PUSH) EARLIER IN THE MORNING. IT WAS DETERMINED AND VERIFIED THAT PICIS WAS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM THAT AFFECTED ALL OF THE VENTS IN VENTILATOR MODE. PICIS WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE AESTIVA AND PROBLEM WENT AWAY. SPOKE WITH GE TECH SUPPORT. WENT INTO THE SERVICE ERROR LOG ON THE AESTIVA. ALL VENTILATORS HAD A 'WATCHDOG ERROR' IN THE LOG.

THE REPORTED INCIDENT OCCURRED SOLELY BECAUSE OF A UNIQUE SET OF SEQUENTIAL OPERATOR ERRORS. THIS SCENARIO IS UNIQUE BECAUSE THE OPERATOR ENTERED THE SAME ERRONEOUS SPECIMEN NUMBER ON TWO CRITICAL WINDOWS; ON THE RESULT ENTRY WINDOW, IF THE OPERATOR HAD ENTERED ANY SPECIMEN NUMBER OTHER THAN THE SAME ONE THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LINKED PREVIOUSLY, THE MEDICAL DEVICE WOULD HAVE DETECTED THE OPERATOR ERROR. WYNDGATE RECOMMENDS THAT THE SITE RETRAIN ITS EMPLOYEES ON THE PROPER USE OF WYNDGATE'S SOFTWARE. IT SHOULD ALSO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL OPERATOR CONTROLS ON ITS PROCESS LINKING THE SPECIMEN TO THE PATIENT. THE MEDICAL DEVICE IS DEPENDENT ON THE OPERATOR CONSISTENTLY AND ACCURATELY ENTERING CORRECT DATA FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THIS SYSTEM. THE SOFTWARE CAN ONLY REACT TO THE DATA THAT IS ENTERED. IN THIS CASE, WHERE THE WRONG DATA WAS ENTERED TWICE, HHB HAD NO WAY TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME. THE LINKAGE OF THE SPECIMEN TO THE PATIENT IS A CRITICAL ENTRY POINT WHICH FURTHER DEVICE PROCESSING OCCURS. A REMINDER WILL BE SENT TO ALL CLIENTS TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER SPECIMEN LINKAGE AND DATA ENTRY. ACTION TAKEN - AS A PRECAUTION, WYNDGATE SENT A PRODUCT BULLETIN TO ALL OF ITS CLIENTS USING THE HBB SYSTEM REITERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER SPECIMEN LINKAGE AND DATA ENTRY. THIS SAME NOTICE WILL ALSO EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO THOROUGHLY TRAIN EMPLOYEES ON THE PROPER USE OF THE HBB SYSTEM.

2423983	0	A CUSTOMER REPORTED A TECHNICIAN STUCK HIMSELF ON THE NEEDLE INSIDE THE BACT/ALERT ADAPTER CAP (PN 279012) WHILE TRYING TO GET THE INSERT OUT OF THE ADAPTER TO DRAW BLOOD CULTURES. THE TECHNICIAN WAS IN THE PROCESS OF INSERTING A VACUUM CONTAINER TUBE WHEN THEIR HAND SLIPPED INTO THE ADAPTER CAP CAUSING THEIR FINGER TO BE STUCK BY THE SHEATHED NEEDLE. THE NEEDLE IS USED TO PIERCE THE SEPTUM IN BACT/ALERT BLOOD CULTURE BOTTLES. THERE IS A THIN RUBBER SHEATH/COVER THAT RETRACTS WHEN THE ADAPTER CAP IS PLACED ON THE CULTURE BOTTLE. THE BACT/ALERT ADAPTER CAP IS USED TO FACILITATE THE FILLING OF BLOOD INTO A BACT/ALERT BLOOD CULTURE BOTTLE. THE BACT/ALERT BLOOD COLLECTION ADAPTER INSERT IS USED FOR POSITIONING A TRANSFER NEEDLE TO FACILITATE BLOOD COLLECTION INTO BLOOD COLLECTION TUBES. THE ADAPTER CAP PACKAGE INSERT RECOMMENDS THE TECHNICIAN TO FOLLOW THE FACILITY'S APPROVED PROCEDURES FOR USE FOR THE BACT/ALERT BLOOD COLLECTION ADAPTER CAP AND INSERT. THE TEST PROCEDURE STATES TO PLACE THE ADAPTER CAP ON BACT/ALERT BLOOD CULTURE BOTTLES FIRST, AND, IF ADDITIONAL BLOOD IS REQUIRED FOR OTHER TESTS, TO INSERT THE ADAPTER INSERT, LOCK INTO PLACE AND NOW THE APPARATUS IS COMPATIBLE WITH VACUUM COLLECTION TUBES. AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN OPENED FOR THIS INCIDENCE. THE ORIGINAL KIT WAS DISPOSED AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR INVESTIGATION, BUT THE CUSTOMER DID SEND SIMILAR KITS TO BE INSPECTED. THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT KNOW THE LOT NUMBER AS THE ADAPTER CAPS ARE ADDED TO A COMMUNAL BIN. THE EVENT IS REPORTABLE TO THE FDA AS AN ADVERSE EVENT BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER HAD TO SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT TO DETERMINE EXPOSURE TO THE ADAPTER CAP NEEDLE AND THE CUSTOMER WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT WAS ADMINISTERED OR THE RESULTS OF ANY TESTS. A REVIEW OF THE RETURNED ADAPTER CAPS AND ADAPTER CAP INSERTS FOUND NO FUNCTIONAL ISSUES WITH EITHER THE ADAPTER CAP OR THE INSERT. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT, THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DUE TO ACCIDENTAL CUSTOMER ERROR THAT RESULTED IN THE CUSTOMER'S FINGER SLIPPING INSIDE THE ADAPTER CAP AND ADAPTER CAP INSERT AND BEING STUCK BY THE BLOOD COLLECTION SET NEEDLE. THE ADAPTER CAP AND INSERT ARE BIOMERIEUX PARTS AND ARE DESIGNED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH BLOOD COLLECTION SETS THAT ARE MADE BY OTHER MANUFACTURERS. A REVIEW OF BD'S PACKAGE INSERT INCLUDES A GENERAL PRECAUTION STATEMENT REGARDING THE USE OF SHARPS: HANDLE ALL BIOLOGIC SAMPLES AND BLOOD COLLECTION "SHARPS" (LANCETS, NEEDLES, LUER ADAPTERS, AND BLOOD COLLECTION SETS) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF YOUR FACILITY. OBTAIN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION IN THE EVENT OF ANY EXPOSURE TO BIOLOGIC SAMPLES (E.G., THROUGH A PUNCTURE INJURY) SINCE SAMPLES MAY TRANSMIT VIRAL HEPATITIS, HIV (AIDS), OR OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. UTILIZE ANY SAFETY ENGINEERED FEATURE IF THE BLOOD COLLECTION DEVICE PROVIDES ONE. THE BACT/ALERT BLOOD COLLECTION ADAPTER CAP IS A PLASTIC CAP THAT FITS OVER BLOOD CULTURE BOTTLES AND IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BLOOD COLLECTION SET. BIOMERIEUX DOES NOT PROVIDE OR MANUFACTURE THE BLOOD COLLECTION SET AND THIS MATERIAL IS LISTED IN THE "MATERIALS REQUIRED BUT NOT PROVIDED" SECTION. THE ADAPTER CAP PACKAGE INSERT INSTRUCTS THE USER TO "REFER TO YOUR FACILITY'S APPROVED PROCEDURES FOR USE OF THE BACT/ALERT BLOOD COLLECTION ADAPTER CAP AND INSERT." THE BIOMERIEUX ADAPTER CAP PACKAGE INSERT ALSO CONTAINS STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TEST PROCEDURE ON HOW TO USE THE ADAPTER CAP. STEPS 1-6 PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE ADAPTER CAP WITH BACT/ALERT CULTURE BOTTLES, AND A NOTE FOLLOWS THESE STEPS THAT STATES "IF ADDITIONAL BLOOD IS REQUIRED FOR OTHER TESTS, PLACE THE ADAPTER INSERT INTO THE ADAPTER CAP AND LOCK INTO PLACE. THIS MAKES THE CAP COMPATIBLE WITH VACUUM COLLECTION TUBES." THE LAST STEP IN THE TEST PROCEDURE SECTION STATES "AFTER BLOOD COLLECTION IS COMPLETE, REMOVE THE ADAPTER CAP FROM THE CULTURE BOTTLE AND THEN REMOVE THE NEEDLE FROM THE PATIENT'S VEIN." THE STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USER TO FOLLOW. THE ADAPTER INSERT IS INTENDED TO BE USED AT THE LAST STAGES OF BLOOD COLLECTION IF ADDITIONAL BLOOD IS NEEDED TO BE DRAWN INTO VACUUM COLLECTION TUBES. TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE ADAPTER INSERT SHOULD BE USED AT THE LAST STEP, ADDITIONAL VERBIAGE WILL BE ADDED TO THE ADAPTER CAP PACKAGE INSERT TO INSTRUCT USERS NOT TO REMOVE THE INSERT FROM THE CAP AND TO DISCARD THE BLOOD COLLECTION ADAPTER CAP AND INSERT AFTER USE.><INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

2704659	0	A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BECKMAN COULTER INC. (BEC) REPORTING ERRONEOUS LOW NRBC RESULTS WITH INSTRUMENT GENERATED FLAGS GENERATED BY THEIR UNICEL DXH 800 COULTER CELLULAR ANALYSIS SYSTEM ON ONE SPECIFIC PATIENT ANALYZED TWICE ON THE SAME DAY ON THE SAME INSTRUMENT AS COMPARED TO RESULTS FROM A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT (LH 750) AND THE MANUAL DIFFERENTIAL, WHICH WERE CONSIDERED CORRECT. THE RESULTS PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER ARE SHOWN IN THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT. SAMPLES ARE COLLECTED IN 3 ML GREINER BIOONE VACUETTE DIPOTASSIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE TETRA-ACETIC ACID (K2EDTA) TUBES. THE SAMPLE TESTED WAS STORED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND WAS 1 TO 2 HOURS OLD. CONTROLS ANALYZED IN THE MORNING BEFORE THE INCIDENT RECOVERED WITHIN EXPECTED RANGES. THE DXH 800 INSTRUMENT IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING WITHIN QUALITY CONTROL (QC) SPECIFICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS (ACCURACY) AND REPRODUCIBILITY (PRECISION). IT WAS NOTED THAT THE NRBC FOR THE LH750 WAS REPORTED AS 600+ BECAUSE 600 IS THE UPPER END OF LINEARITY. THE MANUAL DIFFERENTIAL NRBC COUNT WAS REPORTED AS 350/ 15 WHITE BLOOD CELLS (WBC) BECAUSE OF THE LOW WBC COUNT. THIS WOULD NORMALLY BE REPORTED AS NRBC/100 WBCS AS THE INSTRUMENTS REPORT. ALL OTHER DXH 800 CBC AND DIFFERENTIAL RESULTS WERE COMPARED TO THE LH750 SINCE THESE RESULTS WERE STATED TO BE CORRECT AND A COMPLETE MANUAL DIFFERENTIAL WAS NOT PROVIDED. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO A MANUAL DIFFERENTIAL ON ALL SLIDES BECAUSE OF THE LOW WBC COUNT. FURTHER REVIEW OF THE PRINTOUT PROVIDED FOR THE INITIAL DXH 800 RUN SHOWED THAT NE% WAS HIGH, AND LY% AND MO% WERE LOW COMPARED TO THE LH750 BUT WERE ACCOMPANIED BY INSTRUMENT GENERATED FLAGS. IN ADDITION, RBC, HGB, HCT, AND MPV WERE LOW, AND PLATELET (PLT) WAS HIGH AS COMPARED TO THE LH750 WITH NO INSTRUMENT FLAGS. FURTHER REVIEW OF THE PRINTOUT PROVIDED FOR THE DXH 800 RERUN SHOWED THAT NE% WAS HIGH, AND LY% AND MO% WERE LOW COMPARED TO THE LH750 BUT WERE ACCOMPANIED BY INSTRUMENT GENERATED FLAGS. IN ADDITION, RBC AND HCT WERE HIGH, AND PLT AND MPV WERE LOW AS COMPARED TO THE LH750 WITH NO INSTRUMENT FLAGS. THE CAUSE OF THE ERRONEOUS NRBC RESULTS IS UNKNOWN. THE INSTRUMENT GENERATED SYSTEM MESSAGES WITH R FLAGS TO ALERT THE OPERATOR THAT OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM MAY BE AFFECTED AND TO REVIEW THE RESULTS (ERRONEOUS DIFFERENTIAL RESULTS WERE ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY INSTRUMENT GENERATED FLAGS; HOWEVER, ERRONEOUS CBC RESULTS WERE UNFLAGGED). PER LABELING FROM THE DXH 800 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE: - THE DXH 800 SYSTEM MANAGER INCLUDES FLAGS, CODES, AND MESSAGES TO ALERT YOU TO ISSUES WITH PATIENT OR CONTROL RESULTS. YOU CAN ALSO CUSTOMIZE THE FLAGGING OF RESULTS AND DEFINE RULES FOR FLAGGING SAMPLE RESULTS. - ALL SYSTEM MESSAGES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY R (REVIEW) FLAGS.

THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE MONITOR DISPLAYED A FETAL HEART RATE OF 180 BEATS PER MINUTE (BPM) WITH OCCASIONAL ACCELERATIONS TO 200 BPM WHEN IT WAS MONITORING THE BABY. THE CUSTOMER PLACED THE DEVICE BACK INTO SERVICE AND WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY WHICH MONITOR WAS IN USE DURING THE ALLEGED INCIDENT. AS A RESULT, OUR FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER WAS UNABLE TO TEST THE MONITOR. WE ARE CONTACTING THE CUSTOMER TO COLLECT MORE INFORMATION. AT THIS TIME, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSION. WE WILL PROVIDE A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT ONCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED.><THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED FETAL STRIPS DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY TO SPACELABS. A CLINICAL SPECIALIST EVALUATED THE STRIPS AND CONCLUDED THE BELOW. THE STRIP LABELED LABOR TIME DEMONSTRATES NORMAL VARIABILITY OF THE FETAL HEART RATE (FHR). THE STRIP LABELED DELIVERY TIME DEMONSTRATES: OCCASIONAL MILD AND BRIEF FETAL TACHYCARDIA EPISODES AND SEVERAL LATE FHR DECELERATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INDICATOR OF FETAL DISTRESS; SEVERAL EPISODES OF EARLY FHR DECELERATIONS SHORTLY PRIOR TO DELIVERY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ROUTINE HEAD COMPRESSION. BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MONITOR USED DURING THE EVENT, SPACELABS HAS TESTED ALL THE MATERNAL OBSTETRICAL MONITORS IN THE HOSPITAL. TESTING CONFIRMED THAT ALL MONITORS WORKED TO SPECIFICATIONS. NO SUPPORTING INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL SUCH AS LAB WORK, MATERNAL HISTORY, AUTOPSY, ETC.

1693408	1	OUR ANESTHESIA DEPARTMENT IS THE (B) (6) IN THE UNITED STATES TO GO-LIVE WITH AN ANESTHESIA EMR USING EPIC SOFTWARE - (B) (6). ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE EMR IS THE ABILITY TO AUTOMATICALLY CAPTURE ANESTHESIA MACHINE AND PHYSIOLOGIC MONITOR DATA VIA DEVICE INTERFACES. HOWEVER, SHORTLY AFTER GO-LIVE WE NOTICED AN INACCURACY WITH THE DATA COMING FROM THE GE AESTIVA ANESTHESIA MACHINE. AESTIVAS ARE CONFIGURED TO VENTILATE IN ONE OF FOUR MODES -UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN PARENTHESES-: VOLUME CONTROL -V- PRESSURE CONTROL -P- PSV-PRO -O- SIMV-VC -S-. EACH MODE OF VENTILATION IS SUPPOSED TO SEND A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER AS DATA OUTPUT. THIS IDENTIFIER IS THEN SENT TO THE CAPSULE DATACAPTOR SERVER WHERE THE INTERFACE TRANSLATES THE DATA AND SENDS IT TO THE EMR THROUGH INTERNAL TESTING -WITH THE HELP OF CAPSULE-, AND FINALLY VIA DIRECT CONFIRMATION FROM GE SENIOR PRODUCT MGMT, WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT AESTIVAS ARE SENDING WRONG INFO ON VENTILATION MODE THROUGH THEIR SERIAL PORTS. VOLUME CONTROL AND PRESSURE CONTROL BOTH COME OVER AS 'V' AND 'P' RESPECTIVELY - THESE ARE CORRECT. HOWEVER, PSV-PRO IS SENT AS 'P' INSTEAD OF 'O' AND SIMV-VC IS SENT AS 'V' INSTEAD OF 'S'. IN ADDITION TO THE DATA BEING ERRONEOUS, THE PROTOCOL/SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION IS WRONG AS WELL. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE FOUR MODES OF VENTILATION AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THIS DATA IS ACCURATE. OUR FINDINGS HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED DIRECTLY WITH (B) (6), SENIOR PRODUCT MANAGER GE, AND (B) (6), ENGINEER GE. THIS WEEK WE MET WITH A REP OF GE AND WE WERE INFORMED THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT THERE ARE NO PLANS TO FIX IT. AS MORE HOSPITALS AND ANESTHESIA DEPTS ACROSS THE NATION BEGIN TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EMRS, ACCURATE ELECTRONIC DATA INTERFACE WILL BE CRITICAL. WE HAVE GIVEN GE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO RESPOND AND CORRECT THE PROBLEM, BUT TO NO AVAIL. FRANKLY, WE ARE STUNNED BY GE'S LACK OF INTEREST AND RESPONSE.

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM CORROSION WHICH CAN FURTHER DEVELOP INTO AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND; THE COPPER PRESENT IN THE GROUND STRAP WAS EXPOSED TO SODIUM AZIDE FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME TO FORM CORROSION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. INDEPENDENT STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS FOUND ON FIELD RETURNED GROUND STRAPS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COPPER AZIDE DEPOSITS, FORMATION RATES OF COPPER AZIDE, THE FEASIBILITY OF (B)(4) AS A POTENTIAL GROUND STRAP MATERIAL AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. ONE STUDY REVEALED THERE ARE OTHER METALS, POTENTIALLY UTILIZED IN INSTRUMENT DESIGNS, THAT MAY FORM AN UNSTABLE AZIDE COMPOUND ARE GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, BRASS AND TIN. THE (B)(4) PERFORMED A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF (B)(4) AS REPLACEMENT FOR COPPER. (B)(4). A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM AZIDE WAS CONDUCTED. OTHER PARTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING COPPER WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER MATERIAL WITH NO KNOWN POTENTIAL VOLATILE METAL FORMATIONS. INSTRUMENT DESIGNS WILL AVOID THE USE OF BARE COPPER OR TIN COATED COPPER IN AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO SODIUM AZIDE MIGHT BE EXPECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. THE MATERIAL OF THE GROUND STRAP WAS CHANGED TO A (B)(4).

THE CELL-DYN SYSTEM 3000 OPERATOR'S MANUAL, 92430-01, REV H: THE TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE (SECTION 10 PAGES 10-25 TO 10-26) STATES THAT IN THE PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION STEP THE CUSTOMER SHOULD BE OBSERVING WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE CATEGORY OF PROBLEM (HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR MEASUREMENT). SECTION 3, SAMPLE ANALYSIS CYCLE OVERVIEW OUTLINES THE PROCESS OF ANALYSIS (PAGES 3-2 TO 3-4). PRECISE VOLUMES OF BLOOD ARE DILUTED WITH SPECIFIC VOLUMES OF REAGENT ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF ANALYSIS BEING DONE. THE HGB DETERMINATION IS MADE FROM 1.2 UL OF BLOOD ADDED TO 1.5ML OF DILUENT AND 1.5ML HEMOGLOBIN LYSE REAGENT, WHICH IS MIXED BY BUBBLING ACTION IN THE HGB MIXING CHAMBER. THE MIXING CHAMBER AND FLOW CELLS ARE RINSED AFTER EACH CYCLE. THE VOLUME OF LIQUID IN THE MIXING CHAMBER SHOULD BE CONSISTENT CYCLE TO CYCLE. THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED WHILE CHECKING THE MOVEMENT OF SYRINGES AND VALVES, THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH REAGENT IN THE MIXING CHAMBER, WHICH INDICATED A MEASUREMENT PROBLEM FOR HGB ANALYSIS AT MIXING CHAMBER AND A POSSIBLE HARDWARE ISSUE RELATED TO THE FILL/DRAIN OF THE MIXING CHAMBER. TRENDING ANALYSIS: A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT REPORTS, FOR THE PERIOD AUGUST 2007 THROUGH MARCH 2008, DID NOT INDICATE ANY ADVERSE TREND WITH THE CELL-DYN 3000, LIST BASE 91250-01, (WHICH INCLUDED 91323-03) FOR ISSUES WITH ERRATIC/LOW HGB RESULTS. THERE WAS NO SYSTEMIC ISSUE. LABELING: THE EVENT IS ADDRESSED IN THE CELL-DYN 3000 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL, 92420-01, REV H SECTION 3: PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION: SAMPLE ANALYSIS CYCLE OVERVIEW; 3-2 TO 3-4 SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE; 10-25 TO 10-26. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE EVENT WAS EVALUATED. SERVICE REPLACED SOLENOID VALVES THAT WERE INTERMITTENTLY FAILING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT HEMOGLOBIN RESULTS ON PT SAMPLES HAVE BEEN ERRATIC AND LOW WHEN GENERATED USING A CELL-DYN 3000 CS ANALYZER. AN EXAMPLE FOR ONE PT WAS PROVIDED; HGB=5 G/DL COMPARED TO A PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED RESULT OF 15 G/DL. INCORRECT RESULTS WERE NOT REPORTED OUT OF THE LAB. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT REPORTED DUE TO THIS ISSUE.

960282	0	PER THE COMPLAINT TEXT, THE CUSTOMER HAS HAD MULTIPLE INSTRUMENT ISSUES SINCE JUNE 2007 THAT REQUIRED FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) INTERVENTION. THE RECENT ISSUES WERE FOR ERROR CODE 5015 MOTOR STEP LOSS, PROBE UP/DOWN, PROCESSING CENTER. THE FSR RECALIBRATED THE SAMPLE PROBE, REPLACED THE SMALL VOLUME HEATER DUE TO A LEAK, CHANGED BOTH PROBE LINK TUBINGS AND VERIFIED MUP AND WASH DISPENSE VOLUMES. THE FSR PERFORMED A MEIA STATION VERIFICATION BUT IT FAILED. THE PROCEDURE WAS REPEATED SUCCESSFULLY AFTER REPLACING THE MEIA LAMP AND PERFORMING MEIA VERIFICATION. THE FSR ALSO PERFORMED A REAGENT PACK CALIBRATION AND SAMPLE BARCODE CALIBRATION SUCCESSFULLY. THE FSR RAN CONTROLS AND THE QUESTIONABLE SAMPLE (3X) GETTING ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR AXSYM SYSTEM OVER THE TIME PERIOD 2006 THROUGH 2007 DID NOT FIND OTHER COMPLAINTS FOR THE CUSTOMER'S CURRENT OBSERVATION. THE ABBOTT AXSYM SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL VOLUME-1 (66-6749/R3-FEBRUARY 1996) DESCRIBES THE FOLLOWING UNDER THE SECTION SHOWN BELOW: SECTION 7 OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS. RESULT INTERPRETATION/REPORTING. AXSYM ASSAY RESULTS/ANALYTE DETERMINATIONS MUST BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER CLINICAL DATA, E.G., SYMPTOMS, RESULTS OF OTHER TESTS, PATIENT HISTORY, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM CLINICAL EVALUATION, AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES. ALL OF THIS DATA MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR DIAGNOSIS AND GOOD PT CARE MANAGEMENT. SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS, OBSERVED PROBLEMS PROVIDES A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE A DISPENSE ISSUE WITH THE BULK SOLUTION 1 AND 3 WHICH IS DESCRIBED UNDER MEIA TEST RESULTS TOO LOW AND RESULTS ERRATIC, DISCREPANT, AND/OR EXPERIENCING IMPRECISION. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE AXSYM ANALYZER LIST # 7A83 GENERATED A DISCREPANT HCV RESULT FOR A PT SAMPLE. THE PATIENT SAMPLE INITIALLY RECOVERED A VALUE OF 0.7 S/CO (SAMPLE/CUTOFF), WHICH IS NEGATIVE BUT WAS QUESTIONED, AS IT DID NOT MATCH THE PT HISTORY. AN OLD SAMPLE FROM THE PT WAS ANALYZED WITHOUT CENTRIFUGING FIRST AND RECOVERED A VALUE OF 1.25 S/CO. THE 'PARENT' SAMPLE WAS CENTRIFUGED THEN RUN RECOVERING A VALUE OF 1.23 S/CO. THE FIRST SAMPLE WAS RERUN WITHOUT CENTRIFUGING RECOVERING A VALUE OF 1.25 S/CO, WHICH WAS REPORTED. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT REPORTED.

1174283	1	THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. >< (B)(4). THE INITIAL REPORT WAS SUBMITTED UNDER BRAND NAME APS INPUT OUTPUT MODULE, (B)(4) MANUFACTURING SITE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE PERFORMED ON BRAND NAME ACCELERATOR DECISION MANAGER, (B)(4) MANUFACTURING SITE. THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS ISSUE FOR THE ACCELERATOR DECISION MANAGER (ADM) INDICATES THAT THE CUSTOMER IS RUNNING THE ACCELERATOR AUTOMATED PROCESSING SYSTEMS (APS) WORKCELL WITH DECISION MANGER (ADM) MIDDLEWARE. AN ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM CONNECTED TO THE APS WORKCELL REPORTED A HIGH MICRO ALBUMIN (>500 MG/L) FOR SAMPLE IDENTIFICATION (B)(4). THE CREATININE ASSAY FOR THIS SAMPLE HAD INITIAL RESULT AS <400 UMOL/ L. A SAMPLE PRESENTATION ERROR WAS GENERATED FOR THIS SAMPLE AND A SAMPLE QUEUE ERROR WAS GENERATED FOR THE NEXT SAMPLE ((B)(4)). THE SAMPLE PRESENTATION AND SAMPLE QUEUE ERRORS WERE BOTH DOCUMENTED AT THE APS, HOWEVER THE RESULTS RECEIVED BY THE ADM DID NOT INCLUDE ERROR FLAGS FOR THESE ERRORS AS EXPECTED. THE REVIEW OF THE ADM LOGS DETERMINED THAT THE CONFIGURATION OF ADM WAS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF INSTRUMENT SERVICE ADVISORY (B)(4), WHICH WAS BASED ON APS SOFTWARE V1.2. WITH THE UPGRADE TO APS SOFTWARE V1.3.1, THE SOFTWARE WAS CHANGED AND ADM SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONFIGURED ACCORDING TO (B)(4). AS A RESULT OF THE CONFIGURATION NOT BEING UPDATED IN ADM, THE MIDDLEWARE WAS UNABLE TO CAPTURE THE NOTIFICATION MESSAGES AND THEREFORE DID NOT FLAG THE TEST RESULTS FOR THE AFFECTED SAMPLES. THE ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) WAS INSTRUCTED TO COMPLETE (B)(4) AT THIS ACCOUNT. AFTER THIS ISA WAS COMPLETED, ADM WAS STILL NOT PROPERLY CAPTURING THE NOTIFICATION MESSAGES FROM THE APS FOR SAMPLE PRESENTATION/ SAMPLE QUEUE ERRORS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CUSTOMER USES THE SAMPLE TYPE AS PART OF THE BARCODE IDENTIFICATION (ID). FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE REQUEST ID IS (B)(6), THEN SAMPLE ID (B)(6) IS FOR A SERUM SAMPLE AND (B)(6) IS FOR A URINE SAMPLE. ADM IS CONFIGURED TO ASSOCIATE SAMPLE PRESENTATION/SAMPLE QUEUE ERRORS BASED ON A SID TO THE INTERNAL ADM REQUEST ID. THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FOR ADM HAS THE SID EQUIVALENT TO THE REQUEST ID, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS CUSTOMER. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FOR (B)(4) (THE SAMPLE TUBE WITH SAMPLE PRESENTATION ERROR), THE URINE CREATININE WAS REPEATED AND THIS RESULT OF (B)(6) WAS RELEASED TO THE LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM (LIS). THIS URINE CREATININE FOR THIS SAMPLE WAS THEN REPEATED THE FOLLOWING DAY AND A RESULT OF (B)(6) WAS REPORTED OUT TO THE LIS. FOR THIS SAME SAMPLE, THE MICRO ALBUMIN RESULT WAS NOT REPORTED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY, WITH A VALUE 0.9. FOR THE NEXT SAMPLE ((B)(6)) WHICH WAS FLAGGED WITH SAMPLE QUEUE ERROR, THE POTASSIUM AND CREATININE RESULTS WERE REPORTED TO THE LIS. PER THE APS OPERATIONS MANUAL IN APPENDIX B UNDER WARNING MESSAGE W026, THESE SAMPLE RESULTS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REPORTED OUT. THIS SAMPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOLLECTED AND THEN HAVE ALL ASSAYS REPEATED. A SEARCH OF COMPLAINT DATABASES DID NOT FIND OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE. ON (B)(6) 2007, A PRODUCT CORRECTION LETTER (FA02AMAR2007) WAS ISSUED TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH INFORMATION CONCERNING SAMPLE PRESENTATION AND SAMPLE QUEUE ERRORS ON THE APS WORKCELL AND CONFIGURATION OF THEIR MIDDLEWARE, INCLUDING ACCELERATOR DECISION MANAGER. A REVIEW OF ACCELERATOR DECISION MANAGER INTEGRATED PRODUCT CONFIGURATION GUIDE ((B)(6) SEPTEMBER 2007) DETERMINED THAT AS PART OF THIS ISA, THE ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE IS INFORMED TO UPDATE THE HANDLING OF AUTOMATION WARNING MESSAGES FROM THE APS. THE PURPOSE IS THE APS MAY GENERATE ERRORS THAT REQUIRE ADM TO PREVENT THE RESULTS FROM BEING REPORTED. WHEN A SAMPLE PRESENTATION OR A SAMPLE QUEUE ERROR IS DISPLAYED AT THE APS EXCEPTION SCREEN, AN AUTOMATION WARNING MESSAGE IS GENERATED WITH A WARNING CODE OF X01 OR X02. THE ABBOTT ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL (PART NUMBER 201837-105, MAY 2008) INDICATES UNDER SECTION 7, OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS, LIMITATIONS OF RESULT INTERPRETATION: ASSAY RESULTS MUST BE USED WITH OTHER CLINICAL DATA, FOR EXAMPLE, SYMPTOMS, OTHER TEST RESULTS, PATIENT HISTORY, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM CLINICAL EVALUATION, AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES. ALL DATA MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR PATIENT CARE MANAGEMENT. IF ASSAY RESULTS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL EVIDENCE, ADDITIONAL TESTING IS SUGGESTED TO CONFIRM THE RESULT. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR ITS INTENDED USE. HOWEVER, ERRORS CAN OCCUR DUE TO POTENTIAL OPERATOR ERRORS AND ARCHITECT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY LIMITATIONS. A REVIEW OF THE ACCELERATOR APS OPERATIONS MANUAL ((B)(6) - SEPTEMBER 2008) DETERMINED TROUBLESHOOTING ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED IN APPENDIX B FOR SAMPLE PRESENTATION AND SAMPLE QUEUE ERRORS. THE ACCELERATOR DECISION MANAGER (ADM) IS DESIGNED FOR WORKFLOW AND DATA MANAGEMENT FOR ALL OF THE IMMUNOCHEMISTRY AND HEMATOLOGY SYSTEMS TO WHICH IT IS CONNECTED, IN CLINICAL LABORATORIES HAVING MULTIPLE INSTRUMENTS. A SINGLE BI-DIRECTIONAL CONNECTION WITH THE LIS OR HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (HIS) ALLOWS THE ACCELERATOR DECISION MANAGER TO RECEIVE WORK ORDERS AND OUTPUT ANALYTICAL RECORDS. A MALFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM WAS IDENTIFIED. THE COMPLAINT TEXT INDICATES IT WAS DETERMINED THE ADM MIDDLEWARE IS NOT PERFORMING AS INTENDED AND PER DESIGN WHEN USING THE SAMPLE TYPE AS PART OF THE BARCODE ID. THIS IS A FINAL REPORT. >< THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT MICROALBUMIN RESULTS FOR ONE PATIENT WERE GENERATED AT GREATER THAN 500 MG/L ON THE ARCHITECT C16000 ANALYZER/APS SYSTEM. THE SAMPLE WAS DILUTED AND GENERATED A FINAL RESULT OF 42 MG/L. THE SAMPLE WAS THEN RETESTED NEAT AND GENERATED A RESULT OF 6.9 MG/L. THE ABBOTT CUSTOMER TECHNICAL ADVOCATE (CTA) INSPECTED THE REACTION GRAPHS AND SUSPECTS THE INITIAL RUN WAS PERFORMED ON SERUM AND NOT URINE.  NO SUSPECT RESULTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE LAB. IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE ANALYZER ASPIRATED FROM AN INCORRECT SAMPLE. THERE IS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED.

3434604	1	I WRITE TO YOU TO IDENTIFY A DESIGN FLAW WITH RESPECT TO A RETROFIT TO THE GE ADU ANESTHESIA WORKSTATION THAT I FEEL CAN COMPROMISE PT SAFETY IN THE OPERATING ROOM. OUR INSTITUTION PURCHASED SEVERAL EARLY EDITIONS OF THE GE ADU IN THE LATE 1990'S. THEY WERE FACTORY FITTED WITH 2 CRT MONITORS, THE LEFT ONE FOR VENTILATORS PARAMETERS, THE RIGHT FOR ECG, NIBP, SPO2, ETCO2, ET GAS AND OTHER PT PHYSIOLOGIC PARAMETERS. OVER A PERIOD OF 13-14 YRS THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE CRT MONITORS BEGAN TO FADE. WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS, GE HAS RETROFITTED 2 OF OUR ADU MACHINES WITH NEW CRT MONITORS. THESE MONITORS HAVE A NEW ON/OFF SWITCH ON THE UPPER LEFT BORDER OF THE MONITOR THAT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY PRESENT. THIS NEW ON/OFF SWITCH HAS A VERY LOW PRESSURE REQUIRED FOR ACTIVATION/DEACTIVATION AND IS THE ONLY POWER SWITCH ON THE ADU THAT IS NOT RECESSED. AS A RESULT, I HAVE HAD AT LEAST 6 SEPARATE EPISODES WHERE STAFF HAS BRUSHED AGAINST THE NON-RECESSED SWITCH INTRAOPERATIVELY, RESULTING IN THE SHUT DOWN OF THE MONITOR DISPLAYING PT PHYSIOLOGIC PARAMETERS DURING SURGERY. THE MONITOR TAKES AT LEAST 1-2 MINS TO REBOOT WITH SOME PARAMETERS TAKING SEVERAL MINS BEFORE THEY ARE AGAIN DISPLAYED. I PERSONALLY HAD A DIFFICULT INTUBATION IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, WHERE THIS SWITCH WAS INADVERTENTLY BRUSHED TO THE "OFF" POSITION, WITH LOSS OF SPO2/ECG/ETCO2 WHILE I WAS INTUBATING THE PT. PARALYSIS HAD ALREADY BEEN INDUCED. I HAD NO ETCO2 TO CONFIRM SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE EMERGENCY TUBE PLACEMENT AND NO SPO2 MONITOR TO CONFIRM SUCCESS/FAILURE OF OTHER FORMS OF VENTILATION. STAFF LITERALLY HAD TO RUN TO ICU FOR A COLORIMETRIC CO2 DETECTOR AND TO PACU FOR A PORTABLE SPO2 MONITOR WHILE THE ADU MONITOR POWERED BACK UP AND WENT THROUGH SELF TESTING. THE SIMPLE FIX TO THIS SAFETY PROBLEM WOULD BE TO RECESS THIS SWITCH SO IT COULD NOT BE INADVERTENTLY PRESSED. A THICK, HOLLOW PLASTIC WASHER GLUED OVER THE SWITCH COULD WORK, EFFECTIVELY RECESSING THE SWITCH. AT THE PRESENT TIME I AM TAPING A ROLL OF TAPE OVER THE SWITCH (ACTING LIKE A LARGE WASHER) TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL DEACTIVATION OF THE SWITCH. THE MAIN POWER SWITCH AND O2 FLUSH VALVE ON THE ADU ARE CURRENTLY RECESSED, AND THE ADU IS LIKELY ONLY GOING TO BE SUPPORTED FOR ANOTHER FEW YRS BY THE MFR.

THE REPEAT RUN WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE LOWER WBC OBTAINED BY MANUAL COUNT WHICH THE LAB CONSIDERS CORRECT. NO ERRONEOUS RESULTS WERE REPORTED OUT OF THE LABORATORY. THERE WAS NO DEATH, INJURY, OR CHANGE TO PATIENT TREATMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE INFORMATION WERE NOT PROVIDED FOR THIS INVESTIGATION. CONTROLS WERE RUN BEFORE AND AFTER THE EVENT. THE UNIT IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING WITHIN QC SPECIFICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS. RAW DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE RAW COUNT RATE FOR RUN 1 IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN RUN 2. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAW COUNTS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE WBC RESULTS. MOREOVER, THE RAW COUNT RATE TRENDS DOWN WITH COLLECTION TIME FOR RUN 1 WHILE IT REMAINED FLAT FOR RUN 2. A BCI FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) REPLACED THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: VL3NO TUBE, SOL21, CHECK VALVE, AND VL10. FSE STATED UP VERIFICATION PASSES.

2854922	1	(B)(6). DATE RECEIVED: (B)(4) 2012. ACTUAL ERROR: YES. DESCRIPTION: SITUATION: A FENTANYL INFUSION WAS ORDERED USING EPIC SOFTWARE FOR A (B)(6) PT AT A RATE OF 2 MCG/KG/HR, FOR A TOTAL OF 30 MCG/HR. THE ALARIS PUMP USED TO ADMINISTER THE INFUSION DID NOT HAVE AN OPTION TO SELECT 30 MCG/HR. THE PUMP WAS THEN INADVERTENTLY PROGRAMMED TO ADMINISTER 30 MCG/KG/HR. BACKGROUND: FENTANYL IS A STRONG AGONIST AT MU-OPIOID RECEPTORS, WITH A RELATIVELY RAPID ONSET AND SHORT DURATION OF ACTION. INTRAVENOUS FENTANYL IS COMMONLY USED FOR ANALGESIA AND FOR ANESTHESIA, OFTEN IN COMBINATION WITH A BENZODIAZEPINE. AS A POTENT OPIOID AGONIST, ITS SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE POTENTIALLY FATAL, ESPECIALLY IF ADMINISTERED AT HIGH, INAPPROPRIATE DOSES. IN PARTICULAR, THESE SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE SOMNOLENCE, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, SEIZURES, AND COMA. CONTINUOUS SEDATION OR ANALGESIA WITH FENTANYL FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENT IS RECOMMENDED WITH AN INITIAL IV BOLUS OF 1-2 MCG/KG AND THEN 1 MCG/KG/HR. TITRATION TO DESIRED EFFECT IS APPROPRIATE WITH USUAL DOSING AT 1-3 MCG/KG/HR, THOUGH SOME PTS REQUIRE 5 MCG/KG/HR. ASSESSMENT: A MEDICATION ERROR OCCURRED IN OUR HOSPITAL AND WAS RECORDED AS A NEAR MISS MEDICATION EVENT IN OUR VOLUNTARY ONLINE REPORTING SYSTEM, QUANTROS. THIS ERROR COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A PEDIATRIC PT RECEIVING AN OVERDOSE OF MEDICATION (FENTANYL INFUSION), POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN SEVERE HARM HAD THE ERROR NOT BEEN DISCOVERED PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION. THE MEDICATION SAFETY OFFICER BECAME AWARE OF THE SITUATION AFTER REVIEWING QUANTROS REPORTS AND FURTHER EVALUATED THE OPTIONS FOR ORDERING PEDIATRIC INFUSION IN THE EPIC SYSTEM. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE UNITS AVAILABLE TO SELECT WHEN ORDERING A MEDICATION DID NOT MATCH THE UNITS AVAILABLE TO SELECT FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEDICATION VIA ALARIS PUMPS FOR ALL PEDIATRIC INFUSIONS. AT THE TIME OF THE ERROR, PROVIDERS COULD NOT APPROPRIATELY ORDER FENTANYL INFUSIONS (AND CERTAIN OTHER MEDICATIONS) FOR PEDIATRICS. THESE INFUSIONS COULD ONLY BE ORDERED IN MCG/HR OR ML/HR, HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD BE ORDERED IN MCG/KG/HR (PER THE JOINT COMMISSION AND TO COMPLY WITH GUARDRAILS ON ALARIS PUMPS). ALARIS PUMPS USED TO ADMINISTER THESE INFUSION TO PTS ARE PROGRAMMED WITH THE UNITS, MCG/KG/HR. IN THIS SITUATION, THE UNITS FOR FENTANYL DID NOT CORRESPOND BETWEEN THE ALARIS PUMP AND THE EPIC SYSTEM, SO THE PUMP WOULD NOT ALLOW THE DOSE TO BE SELECTED AS ORDERED IN EPIC. SINCE THE DOSE OF 30 MCG/HR WAS NOT A PROGRAMMABLE OPTION, THE PUMP WAS INADVERTENTLY PROGRAMMED FOR 30 MCG/KG/HR. THE PT RECEIVED A BOLUS THAT WAS WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AND THE ERROR WAS DISCOVERED PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING THE INCORRECT INFUSION, THEREFORE, THE PT WAS NOT HARMED. RECOMMENDATION: UNITS SHOULD CORRESPOND BETWEEN THE EPIC SYSTEM AND ALARIS PUMPS TO PREVENT POTENTIAL MEDICATION ERRORS FROM OCCURRING. WITHOUT MATCHING UNITS, NURSES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CONVERTING THE DOSES TO APPROPRIATE UNITS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN A DELAY OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION AND A MEDICATION ERROR DUE TO MISCALCULATION, OR INAPPROPRIATE DOSING UNITS MAY BE SELECTED, WHICH COULD CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO PTS. THE UNITS DISPLAYED ON ALARIS PUMPS CANNOT BE ALTERED, SO THE EPIC SYSTEM REQUIRES MODIFICATION. THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO SELECT UNITS FOR MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE MODIFIED IN THE EPIC SYSTEM SO THAT THEY MATCH THE ALARIS PUMPS. THESE UNITS SHOULD BE ADDED AS AN OPTION AS A DROP-DOWN BOX FROM THE MAGNIFYING GLASS ICON. HIGHLIGHTING THE UNITS AVAILABLE ON THE ALARIS PUMPS IN EPIC MAY ALSO HELP MAKE PRESCRIBERS AWARE THAT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PUMPS. NURSES AND PROVIDERS SHOULD BE EDUCATED ABOUT THIS NEAR MISS MEDICATION ERROR, AS WELL OF THE NEW FEATURES THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED INTO THE SYSTEM. IF ANY MEDICATION IS MISSED AND THIS SITUATION SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THE PHARMACY SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH TOOLS AND CONVERSION CHARTS TO ASSIST WITH UNIT AND DOSE CONVERSIONS THAT MAY BE COMMONLY USED. WHENEVER THIS PROCEDURE OCCURS, A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE STEPS TAKEN TO ENSURE CORRECT DOSAGE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED. THESE INDIVIDUAL CASES SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE MEDICATION SAFETY OFFICER WHO SHOULD F/U WITH THE MAKING ADD'L CHANGES IN THE EPIC SYSTEM AS NECESSARY. MEDICATION ADMINISTERED TO OR USED BY THE PT: NO. OUTCOME: THE PT WAS NOT HARMED. WHEN AND HOW WAS ERROR DISCOVERED: THE PT RECEIVED A BOLUS THAT WAS WITHIN RANGE AND THE ERROR WAS DISCOVERED PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING THE INCORRECT INFUSION, THEREFORE, THE PT WAS NOT HARMED. PT COUNSELING PROVIDED: UNK. REPORTER'S RECOMMENDATION: UNITS SHOULD CORRESPOND BETWEEN THE EPIC SYSTEM AND ALARIS PUMPS TO PREVENT POTENTIAL MEDICATION ERRORS FROM OCCURRING. WITHOUT MATCHING UNITS, NURSES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CONVERTING THE DOSES TO APPROPRIATE UNITS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN A DELAY OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION AND A MEDICATION ERROR DUE TO MISCALCULATION, OR INAPPROPRIATE DOSING UNITS MAY BE SELECTED, WHICH COULD CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO PTS. THE UNITS DISPLAYED ON ALARIS PUMPS CANNOT BE ALTERED, SO THE EPIC SYSTEM REQUIRES MODIFICATION. THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO SELECT UNITS FOR MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE MODIFIED IN THE EPIC SYSTEM SO THAT THEY MATCH THE ALARIS PUMPS. THESE UNITS SHOULD BE ADDED AS AN OPTION AS A DROP-DOWN BOX FROM THE MAGNIFYING GLASS ICON. HIGHLIGHTING THE UNITS AVAILABLE ON THE ALARIS PUMPS IN EPIC MAY ALSO HELP MAKE PRESCRIBES AWARE THAT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PUMP. NURSES AND PROVIDERS SHOULD BE EDUCATED ABOUT THIS NEAR MISS MEDICATION ERROR, AS WELL OF THE NEW FEATURES THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED INTO THE SYSTEM. IF ANY MEDICATION IS MISSED AND THIS SITUATION COMES UP AGAIN, A PROCEDURE OF HAVING THE NURSE CHECK WITH A PHARMACIST TO VERIFY THE UNIT CONVERSION SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THE PHARMACY SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH TOOLS AND CONVERSION CHARTS TO ASSIST WITH UNIT AND DOSE CONVERSIONS THAT MAY BE COMMONLY USED.

5705332	0	><during surgery, the provider noticed the readings for co2 and o2 were far below normal. ventilator volume looked normal and there were no error messages displayed on the equipment. the gas analyzer module was tested with calibration gas and had readings that were within normal tolerances for the cal gas. just prior to swapping out the entire machine, it was decided to replace the gas sampling line. this immediately corrected the problem. there was delay of about 20 minutes in the procedure while troubleshooting. the suspect sampling line was visually inspected, but no defects were noted. pressure testing of the sampling line indicated a significant leak, which would be consistent with the problem in the room. to find the source of the leak, the line was being prepared to be submerged in water to look for bubbles. at this time the fitting at one end fell apart, so the leak became obvious. packaging from the defective line was not retained, so the lot number is unknown. another line from the same supply bin had lot# 155042.

THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF PT IMPACT OR INJURY AS A RESULT OF THIS ERROR. WE HAVE REC'D AND INVESTIGATED TWO SIMILAR CUSTOMER REPORTS OF MALFUNCTION INVOLVING PICIS EMR SOFTWARE APPLICATION. CUSTOMER CLINICIANS REPORTED OBSERVING ERRONEOUS RESULTS WITH THE DEVICE ALLERGY INTERACTIONS FEATURE USED IN CHECKING MEDICATION ORDERS AGAINST DOCUMENTED PT ALLERGY HISTORY. THERE WERE NO ASSOCIATED REPORTS OF MEDICATION ERROR OR PT INJURIES AS A RESULT. OUR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION HAS CONFIRMED AN ERROR CONDITION EXISTS WITHIN SOFTWARE CODE FOR THE DEVICE, WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MULTUM 3RD PARTY DRUG DATABASE CONTENT. THE WORKFLOW IMPACTED IS AS FOLLOWS: PT HAS A DOCUMENTED ALLERGY IN OUR DEVICE APPLICATION TO A SPECIFIC DRUG OR CATEGORY OF DRUGS, CLINICIAN ATTEMPTS TO PLACE AN ORDER FOR A MULTI-COMPONENT MEDICATION WITH ONE OF THE COMPONENTS BEING IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE PT'S ALLERGY, APPLICATION DOES NOT DISPLAY THE APPROPRIATE ALLERGY INTERACTION NOTIFICATION. FOR EXAMPLE: PT HAS AN ALLERGY TO CATEGORY OF 'PENICILLINS' AND THE USER ATTEMPTS TO ORDER 'ZOSYN' (PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM) - NO ALLERGY INTERACTION NOTIFICATION (PIPERACILLIN BELONGS TO THE ALLERGY CATEGORY OF 'PENICILLINS') IS DISPLAYED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IF THE COMPONENT IS THE SAME DRUG AS THE PT ALLERGY, THE ALLERGY CHECKING WILL DISPLAY CORRECTLY. ROOT CAUSE: OUR INVESTIGATION HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE RELATES TO A SOFTWARE CODING ERROR INTRODUCED DURING DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE RELEASE V5.0 SERVICE PACK L, WHICH WAS NOT DETECTED DURING VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION TESTING. SERVICE PACK L WAS RELEASED ON (B)(4) 2011 AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED FORWARD INTO SERVICE PACK M RELEASE, ON (B)(4) 2011. WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT NO EARLIER OR LATER VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE ARE AFFECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTION(S): THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE MEASURES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO PREVENT FURTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS ERROR TO BE EXPERIENCED IN THE FIELD: AFFECTED SERVICE PACK HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM AVAILABILITY ON OUR USER COMMUNITY WEBSITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FDA QSR 21 CFR SUBCHAPTER H PART 806, WE HAVE ISSUED A WRITTEN COMMUNICATION TO ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CLIENTS, EXPLAINING THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS ERROR, ALONG WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO MONITOR DOCUMENTED PT ALLERGIES CLOSELY WHEN PRESCRIBING MEDICATION ORDERS IN OUR DEVICE APPLICATION, USING MULTUM DRUG DATABASE CONTENT. ON (B)(4), A SOFTWARE SOLUTION WAS RELEASED IN SERVICE PACK N FOR V5.0, WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY COORDINATING IMPLEMENTATION WITH ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CLIENTS. WE WILL TRACK THE PROGRESS ON THIS FIELD CORRECTION AND COORDINATE THIS INFO WITH OUR LOCAL FDA DISTRICT RECALL COORDINATOR. AN INTERNAL CAPA INVESTIGATION IS IN PROGRESS TO REVIEW INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR OPPORTUNITIES WHERE IMPROVEMENT IS NEEDED TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF ERROR IN THE FUTURE. (B)(4)

PATIENT #4 WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL ON THE MORNING OF (B)(6) 2015 AND HAD BLOOD DRAWN AS PART OF THE DISCHARGE ORDER. THE PLATELET COUNT WAS 85 K/UL (NORMAL RANGE 150 - 450 K/UL). AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL, THE PATIENT WALKED ACROSS THE STREET TO COAST HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY FOR CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT. A SECOND BLOOD SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED AT COAST AS PART OF ROUTINE BLOOD WORK PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING CHEMOTHERAPY. THE PLATELET COUNT GENERATED BY THE CELL-DYN EMERALD WAS 170 K/UL (NORMAL RANGE 150 - 390 K/UL). CHEMOTHERAPY WAS ADMINISTERED BASED ON THE RESULTS GENERATED. NO CONSEQUENCES OR IMPACT TO THE PATIENT OVER-ALL HEALTH WAS REPORTED.><FIELD SERVICE WAS DISPATCHED AND REPLACED THE COUNTING CHAMBERS W/O APERTURE DUE TO INTERMITTENT ISSUES OBSERVED AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE RBC COUNTING HEAD WAS REPLACED DUE TO NORMAL WEAR. NO FURTHER PLATELET ISSUES WERE OBSERVED. THE SERVICE ACTIVITY PERFORMED IS CONSISTENT WITH ADDRESSING A HIGH PLATELET BACKGROUND OR RESULTS ISSUE. A PRODUCT TREND REVIEW AND ALL CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FOR THIS ISSUE WERE REVIEWED. OUR REVIEW OF THIS DATA DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ADVERSE TRENDS OR ABNORMAL COMPLAINT ACTIVITY. PER THE COMPLAINT TEXT INFORMATION, IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS PERFORMING MONTHLY MAINTENANCE AS PRESCRIBED IN THE CELL-DYN EMERALD OPERATOR'S MANUAL. THE RESULTS INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT ISSUE ARE FROM SAMPLES WHERE THE PATIENTS ARE ON SOME TYPE OF THERAPY, SUCH AS CHEMO, PLATELET, ETC. IF THE CELL-DYN EMERALD SYSTEM IS NOT PROPERLY MAINTAINED, THERAPEUTIC DRUGS CAN POTENTIALLY BUILD UP ON AND AROUND THE RBC/PLT PATH, COUNTING HEAD, ETC. THIS BUILD UP CAN POTENTIALLY AFFECT COUNTING DUE TO CONTAMINATION AND/OR SIZING DUE TO GROSS BUILD UP. FOR THIS REASON, THE CELL-DYN EMERALD HAS A MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE TO HELP ELIMINATE THIS BUILD UP. THE CUSTOMER WAS INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AS OUTLINED IN THE CELL-DYN EMERALD OPERATOR'S MANUAL TO ENSURE OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE.

2326827	1	THE PT HAD A PHYSICIANS ORDER FOR CONTINUOUS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) AND PULSE OXIMETRY -(SPO2)- MONITORING. THIS MONITORING WAS VIEWED ON GE'S APEX PRO CLINICAL INFO CENTER (CIC) LOCATED ON THE ACUTE CARE UNIT AND ALSO CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED BY A MONITORING TECH IN THE TELEMETRY MONITORING UNIT (TMU). AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE, THE SPO2 READING DISAPPEARED FROM PT WINDOW ON CENTRAL INFO CENTER (CIC) FOR BOTH THE UNIT AND THE TMU. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE READING DOES NOT CAUSE AN ALARM TO SOUND AND IS NOT HIGHLIGHTED ON THE VIEWING SCREEN. IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE SPO2 READING HAD BEEN, THE TRANSCEIVER (TX) NUMBER IS VIEWABLE AS IF THE XPOD CABLE FOR THE SPO2 PROBE HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED. UPON VISUALIZATION OF GE'S DT-4500 FH TELEMETRY TRANSCEIVER, THE PULSE OXIMETRY PROBE LED LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED AND THE XPOD CABLE TO THE SPO2 PORT WAS SECURELY IN PLACE. THE XPOD CABLE WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW CABLE WITHOUT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THE TRANSCEIVER WAS REPLACED WITH A DIFFERENT TRANSCEIVER AND IMMEDIATELY BOTH THE ECG AND THE SPO2 READING WERE RE-ESTABLISHED WITH THE CIC FOR BOTH UNIT AND TMU. THE TRANSCEIVER WAS SET ASIDE FOR TESTING BY GE. UPON FURTHER TROUBLESHOOTING, IF THE BATTERY IS REMOVED AND REPLACED, THE TRANSCEIVER WILL RESET ITSELF AND THE SPO2 READING WILL REAPPEAR AND NORMAL OPERATION IS RESTORED.

THE USER REPORTED SEVERAL COMMUNICATION ISSUES BEGINNING WITH THEIR LAB INFORMATION SYSTEM (LIS), MEDITECH, COMMUNICATING WITH WAM, BUT DATA WAS NOT TRANSFERRING BETWEEN THE INSTRUMENT, LINE CONTROLLER (LASC) AND WAM, LATER, THE AUTO-VALIDATION CONCERN WAS ESCALATED TO SYSMEX WAM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER WHO DETERMINED THAT THE RULES ENGINE FILE COULD NOT BE VIEWED DUE TO AN ERROR MESSAGE "FAILED TO FIND GLOBAL PROC LIBRARY MODULE CA_VAL_FL_CHG". THE RULES FILE WAS FOUND TO BE CORRUPT, CAUSING RULES NOT TO TRIGGER TO HOLD THE RESULTS OR ALERT THE USER OF CRITICAL VALUES. THE CORRUPTED RULES TABLE WAS RECONSTRUCTED BY COPYING THE RULES IN THE TEST ENVIRONMENT TO THE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THERE WAS NO ALLEGATION OF DELAY IN TREATMENT DUE TO THE AUTO-VALIDATION OF CRITICAL RESULTS, NOR ANY ADVERSE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF THE CORRECTED REPORT. THE SYSMEX WAM SOFTWARE APPLICATION IS AN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT OF HEMATOLOGY INSTRUMENT TEST ORDER INFO AND RESULTS DATA. THIS SOFTWARE IS CONSIDERED A CLASS I MEDICAL DEVICE DATA SYSTEM (MDDS). THE WAM CONSOLIDATES RESULTS DATA FROM MULTIPLE INSTRUMENTS, EVALUATES RESULTS USING TEST ORDER RULES CRITERIA AND COMMUNICATES THIS INFO TO THE LIS. THE RULES ARE CRITICAL TO THE INTENDED USE OF THIS APPLICATION. RESULTS FROM THE INSTRUMENT AND WAM WERE CORRECTLY DISPLAYED, BUT THE DATABASE TABLE FOR THE RULES WAS CORRUPTED. THE ROOT CAUSE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A POSSIBLE DATABASE CORRUPTION AFTER A DISK IN THE RAID ARRAY WAS IMPACTED BY A BATTERY FAILURE IN (B)(6) 2012. THE INTEGRITY OF A SECTOR ON THE HARD DISK USED BY ORACLE TO READ/WRITE DATA FROM THE RULES TABLE MAY HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. THE FACILITY WAS AWARE OF NUMEROUS COMMUNICATION ISSUES INCLUDING SERVER MAINTENANCE, LASC RESTARTS, BATCH JOBS NOT RUNNING, ETC, WITHIN THE PAST FEW DAYS, BUT THE RULES NOT TRIGGERING TO REQUIRE FURTHER REVIEW AND VALIDATION BY THE USER PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE RESULTS, OR TO ALERT THE USER TO REPORT CRITICAL VALUES TO THE PHYSICIAN WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT. THE ISSUE WAS RECOGNIZED AND THE SAMPLES WERE MANAGED APPROPRIATELY BY THE LAB WITHIN 2-3 HOURS OF THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE ANALYSIS (PHYSICIAN CALLED, RESULTS VERIFIED, REPORT AMENDED). THE INTENDED USE OF THE WAM AND HEMATOLOGY ANALYZERS IS FOR IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC USE IN SCREENING PT POPULATIONS FOUND IN CLINICAL LABORATORIES. RESULTS THAT WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PT'S OTHER CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS REQUIRE VERIFICATION PRIOR TO CLINICAL DECISION MAKING.

EVALUATION METHOD (B)(4) OTHER, A REVIEW OF THE SOFTWARE CODE, BRAIN STORMING MEETINGS, HUMAN ERROR AND FIVE WHYS ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED AS FAILURE TO DOCUMENT THAT ARCHITECT I2000 AND I2000SR INSTRUMENTS WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE TO THE SLOPE SCORE THRESHOLDS WHEN SOFTWARE V5.00 OR HIGHER IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH LLS/PM BOARD FIRMWARE V15 OR 17. THIS ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED DURING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT OF V5.00, BUT NOT CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SOFTWARE RELEASE ACTION PLAN. IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE TWO MANDATORY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS WERE ISSUED TO ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE TO CHANGE THE SLOPE SCORE THRESHOLDS ON ALL AFFECTED ANALYZERS. ALL AFFECTED ANALYZERS HAVE BEEN SERVICED. IN ADDITION, ARCHITECT SYSTEM SOFTWARE V7.0 WILL INCLUDE THIS RESOLUTION. >< ABBOTT ARCHITECT SYSTEM SOFTWARE (B) (4) AND (B) (4) ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE ENHANCED PRESSURE MONITORING (PM) ALGORITHM LIQUID LEVEL SENSE (LLS) BOARD OR PRESSURE MONITORING LIQUID LEVEL SENSE KIT, U10 CHIP AND EJECTORS. SOFTWARE (B) (4) AND (B) (4) USE INCORRECT SLOPE SCORE THRESHOLDS FOR THE ENHANCED LLS BOARD. THIS CAUSED AN INCREASE IN PRESSURE MONITORING ERRORS FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE SOFTWARE (B) (4) OR (B) (4) AND THE ENHANCED LLS BOARD BECAUSE THE THRESHOLD RANGE IS TOO NARROW. THE ISSUE MAY OCCUR ON THE I2000 AND I2000SR MODULES ONLY, AND MAY RESULT IN A DELAY OF RESULTS.

AT THIS TIME, THE INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM PATIENT CARE SERVICES IS THAT THE VOLUME CONTROL AT THE BEDSIDE MONITORS APPEARED TO HAVE SET THEMSELVES TO ZERO AT THE TIME OF THE REBOOT. WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND WE HAVE VERIFIED THAT THE CENTRAL STATION SHOULD NOT/DOES NOT CONTROL THE VOLUMES AT THE BEDSIDE, SO WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR REASON FOR THE VOLUMES TO HAVE RESET TO ZERO. A CALL HAS BEEN PLACED TO PHILLIPS AND WE ARE AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM THEM ON THIS ISSUE. IT IS NOT AN EXPECTATION THAT THE BEDSIDE MONITOR VOLUMES BE SET AT A CERTAIN NUMBER AS WE HAVE THE CENTRAL STATION LOCKED, SO THAT THE VOLUME THERE CAN NOT BE CHANGED. WE ARE WRITING A PROCEDURE FOR SAFETY CHECKS OF THE BEDSIDE MONITORS FOR EVERY DOWNTIME OF THE CENTRAL STATION AND/OR REBOOT OF THE CENTRAL STATION SO THAT WE CAN ASSURE THAT THE VOLUMES ARE SET AS APPROPRIATE WHEN NEEDED. WE EXPECT THE USE OF THE CHECKLIST TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF EVENT IN THE FUTURE. THIS SHOULD BE COMPLETED BY JUNE 20, 2008. IN THE MEANTIME A DEBRIEFING HAS OCCURRED ON THE UNIT AND STAFF ARE AWARE OF THE NECESSITY TO CHECK BEDSIDE ALARM VOLUMES. REGARDING MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT: ON AN EARLIER REPAIR VISIT, JUNE 7, THE PHILLIPS TECHNICIAN FOUND THE SCC - NETWORK INTERFACE CABINET - TO BE VERY DUSTY AND NOTED IT WAS LIKELY THE CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION - NOT DEFINITIVELY - ON JUNE 7, 2007. THE SCC DOES NOT HAVE A CIRCULATION FAN OR FILTERS AND THUS DUSTING AND CLEANING IS NOT ON THE PM RECOMMENDATIONS. PHILLIPS IS OBVIOUSLY NOW AWARE OF THIS AND IS STARTING A PM CYCLE THROUGH THE ICU'S AND TELEMETRY UNIT THIS WEEK. WE WILL FOLLOW-UP TO ASSURE THIS IS KEPT UP. THE ISSUE OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER ON CALL NOT COMING TO THE FACILITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED WITH THE APPROPRIATE STAFF MEMBERS. IN THE FUTURE, THE ON-CALL STAFF WILL COME TO THE FACILITY, ASSESS THE PROBLEM AND THEN NOTIFY PHILLIPS WHEN NEEDED.

IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE STOCKERT 70 SYSTEM WAS CLICKING AND THE TEMPERATURE WAS GOING UP AND DOWN. ALL ECG¿S WERE NOISY. THE NOISE STARTED WHEN THE REDEL CABLE WAS PLUGGED INTO THE PATIENT INTERFACE UNIT (PIU). THE REDEL CABLE AND THE ABLATION ADAPTER WERE REPLACED WITHOUT RESOLUTION. THERE WAS NO CATHETER PLUGGED INTO THE ABLATION CABLE THAT IS PLUGGED INTO THE PIU. WHEN THE C3 INTERFACE CABLE-THERAPEUTIC WAS REMOVED, THE NOISE WENT AWAY AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY TEMPERATURE ON THE STOCKERT, AS IT SHOULD BE. THE C3 INTERFACE CABLE-THERAPEUTIC WAS REPROCESSED MANY TIMES. A NEW CABLE WAS PLUGGED IN AND THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED. THE PROCEDURE WAS CONTINUED WITHOUT PATIENT CONSEQUENCE.

EVALUATION - UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM CORROSION WHICH CAN FURTHER DEVELOP INTO AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND; THE COPPER PRESENT IN THE GROUND STRAP WAS EXPOSED TO SODIUM AZIDE FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME TO FORM CORROSION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SODIUM AZIDE CAN REACT WITH UNPROTECTED COPPER TO FORM AN EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. INDEPENDENT STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS FOUND ON FIELD RETURNED GROUND STRAPS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COPPER AZIDE DEPOSITS, FORMATION RATES OF COPPER AZIDE, THE FEASIBILITY OF STAINLESS STEEL AS A POTENTIAL GROUND STRAP MATERIAL AND OTHER POTENTIAL HAZARDS. ONE STUDY REVEALED THERE ARE OTHER METALS, POTENTIALLY UTILIZED IN INSTRUMENT DESIGNS, THAT MAY FORM AN UNSTABLE AZIDE COMPOUND ARE GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, BRASS AND TIN. THE (B)(4) PERFORMED A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF STEEL AND TIN AS REPLACEMENT FOR COPPER. THE STUDY INDICATED THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXPLOSIVE AZIDES FORMED IF STEEL, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NICKEL AND CHROMIUM, COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BUFFER SOLUTION. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM AZIDE WAS CONDUCTED. OTHER PARTS IDENTIFIED AS CONTAINING COPPER WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER MATERIAL WITH NO KNOWN POTENTIAL VOLATILE METAL FORMATIONS. INSTRUMENT DESIGNS WILL AVOID THE USE OF BARE COPPER OR TIN COATED COPPER IN AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO SODIUM AZIDE MIGHT BE EXPECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. THE MATERIAL OF THE GROUND STRAP WAS CHANGED TO A (B)(4). A MANDATORY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN REQUIRED THAT EVERY COPPER GROUND STRAP BE REPLACED BY FIELD SERVICE TO THE NEW (B)(4) STRAP. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A (B)(4) WZ MECHANISM GROUND STRAP, INSTRUCTIONS ON THE REMOVAL AND PACKAGING OF POTENTIALLY CORRODED GROUP STRAPS WERE INCORPORATED INTO LABELING. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRACKING AND TRENDING FROM (B)(4) 2009 TO (B)(4) 2010 INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS WITH RESPECT TO CORROSION OR ADVERSE EVENTS IN CONJUNCTIONS WITH THE REPLACEMENT (B)(4) ARCHITECT WASH ZONE MECHANISM GROUND STRAP.

5476561	1	a lumbar laminectomy was performed on the pt in the operating room. as is standard for these cases, the pt was moved from the supine to prone position after induction and intubation. the blood pressure cuff and ekg leads were removed from the pt to facilitate moving from supine to prone position on the operating room bed. the ekg leads and blood pressure cuff were then placed on the pt again; 20-25 minutes later, it was noted that the blood pressure cuff was no longer in 'automatic' mode, and blood pressure was not being measured during that time. the issue is that the blood pressure cuff automatically turns off of 'automatic' mode and returns to 'manual' mode. there is no alarm to alert the anesthesia provider that blood pressure measurements are not being taken. the word 'manual' does appear in the blood pressure box on the monitor, however, it is small and difficult to notice, especially with the hectic nature of the operating room. this seems to be an ongoing problem and an issue that occurs frequently to anesthesia providers. in certain cases, this could lead to prolonged undetected hypertension/hypotension that could prove harmful and even deadly for a certain subset of pts. dates of use: 3 hours. diagnosis or reason for use: used to monitor vitals for pts undergoing surgery.

THE PATIENT WHO SUSTAINED INJURY WAS AT RISK FOR RESPIRATORY ARREST DUE TO A NARROWING IN THE TRACHEA. THERE IS NO PLACE ON THE EHR TO LIST SUCH A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE TO EACH AND EVERY CARE TEAM MEMBER WHO OPENED THE EHR FOR THIS PATIENT. THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BREEDS UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE SPEED AT WHICH THE PATIENT COULD DETERIORATE, IN ADDITION TO THE INTRINSIC DELAY IN GETTING TREATMENTS ORDERED BY THE CPOE SYSTEM. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT PATIENTS ARE NEGLECTED WHEN THE NURSE AND CARE TEAM MEMBERS FOCUS ON THE COMPUTERS RATHER THAN THE PATIENTS, SOMETHING THAT IS COMMONPLACE CONSIDERING THE POOR USABILITY OF THE EHRS. THE PT IN QUESTION DEVELOPED ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. CARE WAS DELAYED DUE TO THE ABOVE MENTIONED REASONS. THE PT SUSTAINED A COMPLETE RESPIRATORY ARREST THAT LED TO A CARDIAC ARREST AND ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY. THE EHR DEVICE IS DEFECTIVE IN THAT IT FAILS TO ENABLE EXPEDIENT COMMUNICATION OF THE CRITICAL LIFE THREATENING PROBLEMS OF EVERY PATIENT WHICH CAUSES NEGLECT AND DELAYS IN CARE WHEN LIFE IS ON THE LINE.

THE OUTPATIENT MEDICATION REVIEW POPULATES DRUGS FROM MULTUM DATABASE ((B)(4)) AND THE FORMATTING CANNOT BE CHANGED. THE PHYSICIAN USED THE CONCENTRATION OF INSULIN GLARGINE AND INSULIN LISPRO AS THE DOSE AND ORDERED INSULIN GLARGINE 100 UNITS TWICE DAILY AND INSULIN LISPRO 100 UNITS THREE TIMES DAILY BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS FORMATTED AND DISPLAYED. THE ORDER WAS SUBSEQUENTLY VERIFIED, BUT THE NURSE NOTICED THE ERROR BEFORE THE PT RECEIVED AN OVERDOSE OF INSULIN. PRIOR TO USING THE OUTPATIENT MEDICATION REVIEW, OUR INSTITUTION HAD A DIFFERENT APPLICATION FOR HOME MEDICATIONS WHERE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DRUGS WERE ABLE TO BE CHANGED. WE HAD TAKEN OUT THE CONCENTRATIONS OF THE INSULIN FROM THEIR DESCRIPTIONS BECAUSE IT BECAME A RECURRING ISSUE FOR THE PHYSICIANS TO ORDER THE CONCENTRATION RATHER THAN THE DOSE.

1054751	0	add'l manufacturer narrative: medical center's inpatient pharmacy contacted baxa in 2008 to report that their magnesium sulfate container ran dry before the compounder application prompted them to change the container. a total of 3ml of magnesium sulfate should have been used for the day's tpn production (container = 50ml). it was also reported that their calcium gluconate containers physical remainder was more than half filled (container = 100ml). a total of 78ml of calcium gluconate should have been used for the day's tpn production. a total of 20 tpn bags were compounded for the day's production using the compounder. the customer reported that all bags were recalled from the floor, and that three of the compounded bags had been infused into neonatal pts for 3-4 hrs. the bags were removed from infusion once the issue was discovered. these three pts are in stable condition and did not exhibit any adverse event as a result of the infusion. the facility ran tests on the three pts to determine if excess levels of magnesium were present in blood samples taken. two of the pts blood work indicated a higher than expected level of magnesium. however, this did not require any add'l medical intervention. the third pt did not have elevated levels of magnesium. to investigate the cause of the reported issue and to provide technical assistance, a site visit was conducted at medical center's inpatient pharmacy the next day by baxa associates. in order to investigate the issue, the following items were evaluated: compounder: the entire sys was isolated, including the disposables and ingredient setup to preserve the setup in use during the previous day's production. results of eval: the physical setup of the compounder was correct. all ingredients and inlets were correctly connected to their associated ports. a visual inspection of the hardware that comprises the compounder showed no physical damage. all 24 valve actuators were aligned to the home position. a visual inspection of the valve set revealed no physical damage. all 24 valve cores under the valve set were aligned to the home position. the sys check (qm-15.02 section 9 procedure) was performed with one baxa and two summerlin observers physically confirming the em2400 performance. all three test formula bags completed successfully (within +/- 3%). the functional testing revealed that the compounder performed as designed. the blackbox data: the computer running the compounder operating software and the compounder itself maintain an ongoing dialogue that is recorded in a 'blackbox' file. this provides an audit trail for reference. results of eval: the blackbox data verified that the user who set up the compounder on the day of the reported incident did bypass the barcode verification step for magnesium sulfate. the hospira brand magnesium sulfate was scanned, an audible alarm was received and the empty vial of american regent brand was scanned to bypass the alarm process. upon the magnesium sulfate container running dry, the user was presented with an audible bubble alarm error. the user acknowledged the error 19 times before aborting the bag run. the user proceeded to manually change the calcium gluconate remainder value from 21.14ml to 60.00ml. then, the magnesium sulfate container was swapped out with a new full container, primed and verified. a complete review of the blackbox data showed that the compounder performed as designed and delivered the volumes of the requested ingredients for the day's production. other observations: it was immediately noticed that vials had been retained for several ingredients that were no longer being acquired (an indication that the barcode verification process was being bypassed). hospira brand magnesium sulfate is the current ingredient in use. however, an empty vial of american regent brand magnesium sulfate was placed inside the hood. the technician staff confirmed in follow-on interviews that they scan the barcode from the american regent brand rather than the hospira brand to bypass the barcode verification process during the setup of the compounder. three add'l empty containers for other ingredients were placed on the shelf above the hood. the technician operating the equipment was observed during the site visit. the technician lacked the proper knowledge to safely use the device. the tech did not know how to power the em2400 down. during the setup process of the compounder, the tech did not use the proper techniques for connecting the inlets to the valve, spiking the source ingredients, hanging the source ingredients and labeling the inlets with their barcodes. based on an eval of the documentation associated with this event, it can be concluded that the most likely cause of this issue is that the user inadvertently connected the inlet (tubing) from the ingredient magnesium sulfate to the ingredient port (attachment at compounder site) calcium gluconate, which resulted in magnesium being pumped when calcium was intended and vice versa, thereby administering magnesium rather than calcium. this conclusion is supported by the blackbox data, the physical remainders in the containers, and the test results for the three pts. two of the pts had elevated levels of magnesium but the third pt did not have elevated levels of magnesium. the first two pts had substantial volumes of calcium in their orders. the third pt had no ordered calcium. the compounder performed as designed and delivered the requested ordered volumes of ingredients. during the site visit, the technician who was operating the compounder on the day of the incident was provided add'l training. the hospira brand barcode for magnesium sulfate was addressed to prevent problems that lead to future failure modes. the importance of the verification process during the setup of the compounder was revisited with the director. to ensure that the inlet is attached to the correct port, they were instructed to physically grab the inlet that is being primed and verified and hold on to it as the ingredient is selected for priming. this will provide a visual verification that the ingredient being primed is actually pumping through the inlet that is being held in hand. to prevent this issue from re-occurring, recommendations were made to the customer that baxa provide their facility routine scheduled training sessions and assist in establishing proper policy and procedure for safe compounding practice. device was evaluated at customer site by baxa personnel. >< in 2008, baxa was notified by the customer of two pt involved incidents using the compounder for tpn production. it was reported to baxa that this pt had received a tpn bag containing a higher-than-desired quantity of magnesium. the bag was infused into the pt for 3-4 hrs and then removed once the issue was discovered. the pts blood work indicated that a higher than expected level of magnesium was present. however, no add'l medical intervention was needed. the pt is in stable condition and did not exhibit any adverse event as a result of the infusion. >< in 2008, baxa was notified by the

THE ERROR OCCURRED ONLY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION: THE HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION MUST BE SET UP WITH MULTIPLE FACILITIES OF DATABASE CONFIGURATION MUST INCLUDE ONE MEDICAL RECORDS DATABASE LINKING TO TWO LAB DATABASES. THE MEDICAL RECORDS BEING MERGED MUST HAVE PT VISITS IN BOTH LAB DATABASES. THE MEDICAL RECORDS BEING MERGED MUST HAVE BOTH BLOOD BANK HISTORICAL DATA. THE MEDICAL RECORDS BEING MERGED MUST HAVE DIFFERENT BLOOD TYPES. MEDITECH'S BLOOD BANK INTERNAL REVIEW BOARD EVALUATED THE REPORT OF THE SOFTWARE ERROR. THE SEVERITY, LIKELIHOOD, AND DETECTABILITY WERE ANALYZED. THE SEVERITY OF THE ERROR WAS RATED AS HIGH, BASED ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT UNSUITABLE BLOOD PRODUCT COULD BE RELEASED IF THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL RELIED ONLY ON THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF BLOOD TYPE. STEPS FOR CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WERE INITIATED PER MEDITECH'S ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES. >< MEDITECH HAS IDENTIFIED A SAFETY CONCERN WITH VERSIONS 4.9, 5.4 AND 5.5 OF THE MAGIC BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE. THESE VERSIONS COULD MALFUNCTION, RESULTING IN INCORRECT PT HISTORICAL DATA. THE CUSTOMER RECENTLY RECEIVED A SOFTWARE UPDATE AND WAS VALIDATING THE BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE IN A TEST DATABASE. IN EARLY 2000, THE INFO SYSTEMS TESTER PERFORMED A MERGE OF TWO TEST PT ACCOUNTS WITH BLOOD BANK DATA, INCLUDING HISTORICAL BLOOD TYPE. ACCORDING TO THE VALIDATION SCRIPT, A WARNING MESSAGE SHOULD HAVE DISPLAYED AND THE TESTER PREVENTED FROM COMPLETING THE MERGE. OUR INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE MALFUNCTION COULD OCCUR ONLY WITH A SPECIFIC MULI-FACILITY DATABASE CONFIGURATION WHERE ONE MEDICAL RECORDS DATABASE REFERENCES TWO LAB DATABASES. THE MALFUNCTION HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED AS AFFECTING ANY ACTUAL HOSPITAL PTS. THE POTENTIAL FOR MISDIAGNOSIS BASED ON AN INCORRECT HISTORICAL BLOOD TYPE WAS DEEMED SERIOUS. COMPARISON OF HISTORICAL RECORDS WITH CURRENT RECORDS ARE REQUIRED PRIOR TO A TRANSFUSION. INCORRECT HISTORICAL RECORDS COULD LEAD TO MISDIAGNOSIS OR DELAY WHILE DISCREPANCIES ARE INVESTIGATED.

WEEKLY SITE VISITS WERE CONDUCTED THROUGH DECEMBER 12, 2015 TO INSPECT BOTH WZ MANIFOLDS, AND NO ISSUES WERE OBSERVED. NO CONTRIBUTING FACTOR ON OR AROUND THE DATE OF THE EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED, AND NO SUBSEQUENT OCCURRENCES OF DISCREPANT RESULTS WERE FOUND AFTER THE REPLACEMENT OF WZ MANIFOLD 1 AND THE 4 WZ MANIFOLD VALVES BY THE FSE. CUSTOMER COMPLAINT DATA WAS REVIEWED AND NO ADVERSE OR NON-STATISTICAL TRENDS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEMS OPERATIONS MANUAL WAS REVIEWED AND WAS FOUND TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT IDENTIFY A MALFUNCTION / DEFICIENCY.><THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT A FALSE POSITIVE ARCHITECT B-HCG RESULT OF 132 IU/L WAS GENERATED. THE SAMPLE WAS REPEATED AND A RESULT OF <1.2 IU/L WAS GENERATED. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT.><(B)(4). AN EVALUATION IS IN PROCESS.

2822291	0	A TECH AT THE LAB INDICATED THAT TISSUES IN 5 CASSETTES FROM 2 CASES PROCESSED ON THE SUKURA VIP 5 INSTRUMENT WERE NOT PROCESSED ADEQUATELY, HOWEVER, THE REMAINDER OF TISSUES IN THIRTY-FOUR (34) CASSETTES WERE PROCESSED CORRECTLY. BASED ON CUSTOMER SURVEY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PUMP HAD A CRACKED DIAPHRAGM. THE PUMP DIAPHRAGM IS INTENDED TO BE REPLACED EVERY 12 MONTHS AND ITS REPLACEMENT IS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE RECOMMENDED ANNUAL PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST. THE LAB IN QUESTION DOES NOT HAVE A SVC ARRANGEMENT WITH SAKURA FINETEK, USA, NOR DO OUR RECORDS INDICATE THAT SAKURA FINETEK WAS CONTACTED BY THE SITE TO PERFORM SUCH SERVICES. THEREFORE, SAKURA FINETEK, USA, CANNOT DOCUMENT THAT THE RECOMMENDED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE(S) HAD BEEN PERFORMED AND IF SO, WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMING THE SERVICE WAS PROPERLY TRAINED. THE FACT THAT ONLY 5 CASSETTES FROM 2 CASES WERE NOT PROCESSED CORRECTLY AND MIXTURE OF SMALL AND LARGE SAMPLES WERE PROCESS AT THE SAME TIME RAISES CONCERN OF NON-INSTRUMENT FACTORS. IT IS BEST CLINICAL PRACTICE TO NOT MIX LARGE AND SMALL TISSUE SAMPLES DURING PROCESSING.

2773595	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(4). THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS (DHR) WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS EVENT. THERE WERE NO EVENTS NOTED IN THE DHR THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. ROOT CAUSE: THIS DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE REMAINS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES WERE PROVIDED IN THE INITIAL REPORT FOR THIS EVENT. AN INTERNAL CAPA HAS BEEN INITIATED TO EVALUATE REPORTS OF ELEVATED WBC COUNTS.><TERUMO BCT INTERNAL REFERENCE: (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE (RDF) WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE SIGNALS IN THE RDF INDICATE THAT THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT WAS LIKELY A RESULT OF AN ESCAPE OF WBCS FROM THE LRS CHAMBER TOWARD THE END OF THE PROCEDURE WHEN THE ACCESS ALERTS WERE OCCURRING. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THIS LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE COULD BE DONOR RELATED. IN ORDER TO EFFICIENTLY COLLECT PLATELETS, THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO OPERATE AT A STEADY STATE. ACCESS ISSUES DURING THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE MINIMIZED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE PER THE OPERATOR'S MANUAL. NUMEROUS ALERTS CAN SOMETIMES DELAY THE SYSTEM FROM REACHING STEADY STATE AND RESULT IN NON-OPTIMAL COLLECTIONS. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.
