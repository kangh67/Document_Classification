5346021	0	bottle 8 (ethanol) was removed from the instrument for approximately four (4) minutes at 09:25am on (b)(4) 2015, which is sufficient time to complete manual replacement of the reagent: and the station properties for bottle 8 (ethanol) were reset at 09:30am on (b)(4) 2015. resetting a reagent station sets the concentration to the default value configured in the reagent types definitions unless an alternative value is entered into the instrument software by the user; and resets the number of cassettes processed and the number of cycles and days to zero. based on information provided by the complainant, it was determined that the sub-optimal tissue processing reported was derived from the dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 16:34pm on (b)(4) 2015  which completed at 05:00am on (b)(4) 2015; the "dpc 10 hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:43pm on (b)(4) 2015  which completed at 05:00am on (b)(4) 2015; the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 07:36am on (b)(4) 2015  which completed at 10:40am on (b)(4) 2015 and the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort b at 08:04am on (b)(4) 2015  which completed at 11:08am on (b)(4) 2015. these protocols comprised five (5); 86; 30 and six (6) cassettes respectively  based on data entered into the instrument software by the user. the reagent in bottle 8 (ethanol) was used for the first time in the final dehydration step of the "dpc 10 hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:43pm on (b)(4) 2015. bottle 8 (ethanol) was subsequently used for the final dehydration step of the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 16:34pm on (b)(4) 2015; the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 07:36am on (b)(4) 2015; and the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 08:04am on (b)(4) 2015. although the ethanol concentration calculated by the instrument software for bottle 8 (ethanol) was 99.9%  the ethanol concentration measured by the hydrometer following completion of the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort b at 08:04am on (b)(4) 2015  which completed at 11:08am on (b)(4) 2015  was 90%. this finding indicates that a use error occurred during the replacement of the reagent in bottle 8  which was performed on (b)(4) 2015 prior to commencement of the four (4) protocols from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported by the complainant. the instrument software uses reagent concentration to select reagent stations when a protocol is scheduled. the reagent station with the lowest (in -threshold) concentration of a reagent group or type is selected for the first step using that reagent group or type. reagent stations of increasing concentration are used for the succeeding processing steps of the reagent group or type. reagent with the highest concentration is always used for the final processing step of a reagent group or type before changing to another reagent group or type. as a consequence  bottle 8 (ethanol) was used for the final dehydration step of the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 16:34pm on (b)(4) 2015; the "dpc 10 hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:43pm on (b)(4) 2015; the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 07:36am on (b)(4) 2015; and the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort b at 08:04am on (b)(4) 2015  from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported by the complainant. the minimum final reagent concentration required for ethanol is 98%. the consequences of using ethanol at a concentration less than the minimum required for the final dehydration step in a protocol is re-introduction of water into the tissue which cannot be displaced in subsequent processing steps; and contamination of reagents used in the subsequent processing steps  ultimately resulting in sub-optimal tissue processing. investigation of this complaint found that the instrument operated within specification during execution of the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 16:34pm on (b)(4) 2015; the "dpc 10 hr" protocol started in retort b at 16:43pm on (b)(4) 2015; the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort a at 07:36am on (b)(4) 2015; and the "dpc 3 hr" protocol started in retort b at 08:04am on (b)(4) 2015 from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported by the complainant. the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported was a use error  which occurred when the reagent in bottle 8 (ethanol) was replaced prior to commencement of the protocols from which sub-optimal tissue processing was reported by the complainant.><leica biosystems received a complaint regarding sub-optimal tissue processing from four (4) processing runs  which completed on (b)(6) 2015. the complainant stated that "some tissue cut and sent to pathologist  some tissue on second peloris for reprocessing. fatty tissue and large excisions more affected". on (b)(4) 2015  a leica field support specialist (fss) provided telephone support to the laboratory in order to assist with the circumstances involved in this complaint and to provide applications support. the laboratory provided the ethanol concentration in bottles 3-11 inclusive  which had been measured using a hydrometer. the variance between the directly measured ethanol concentration and that calculated by the instrument software  which is based on data entered by the user was acceptable in all instances except for bottle 8. the measured ethanol concentration in bottle 8 was 90% and the calculated concentration was 99.9%. the laboratory replaced the reagent in bottles 8 (ethanol)  12 (xylene); 13 (xylene) and 14 (xylene) and the wax in the four (4) wax baths. on (b)(4) 2015  leica biosystems melbourne received information from the laboratory confirming that tissue sample from one (1) patient was not diagnosable. a patient identifier  the age/date of birth and the gender of the patient requiring re-biopsy was requested. on (b)(4) 2015  leica biosystems melbourne received further information from the laboratory indicating that re-biopsy of the one (1) patient from whom tissue was not diagnosable had not been performed; and that "the physician was notified but will decide whether or not to re-biopsy upon follow up visit with the patient". the gender and age of the patient were provided. on 06 january 2015  leica biosystems melbourne received the following information from the laboratory "as far as we know  a new biopsy was not performed on this patient"."

1288623	1	nurses are currently manually entering vital signs data into the electronic medical record (emr).  nurses have noticed that the mean pressure value that is calculated by the emr is sometimes different from the mean value displayed on the patient monitor.  a few sample values were obtained: (systolic/diastolic mean) 129/65 81 emr mean 86; 146/78 95 emr 101; 134/54 81 emr 84; 150/98 116 emr 115.  we were unable to verify if this occurs with a different patient monitoring vendor (such as in the er) because in that case the emr does not display the mean value.  nurses reporting this problem say that they have seen much larger variations but i do not have specific numbers to report yet.====================== manufacturer response for patient monitor, (brand not provided)======================per clinical support with ge, the mean pressure is measured in the oscillometric method and is the most accurate pressure value since the systolic and diastolic are then calculated from the mean.  most emr's take the systolic and diastolic numbers and then calculate the mean using a formula intended for auscultatory readings.  therefore there will be variations.

4193325	1	A SIEMENS TECHNICAL APPLICATION SPECIALIST (TAS) WAS DISPATCHED TO THE CUSTOMER SITE. THE TAS SPECIALIST DETERMINED THAT THE ISSUE WAS CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN THE REPORTING RANGES THAT THE TAS HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE. THE TAS CHANGED THE ANION GAP CALCULATION SO THAT IT WOULD NOT CALCULATE IF A RESULT HAD A COMPARATOR. THE TAS ALSO MADE CHANGES TO THE ADVIA 1800 LINEARITY AND CONFIGURED A LOW LIMIT FOR CO2. THE CAUSE OF THE ANION GAP BEING CALCULATED WHEN IT SHOULD NOT HAVE WAS DUE TO A CONFIGURATION ISSUE. THE CENTRALINK DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS PERFORMING ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. NO FURTHER EVALUATION IS REQUIRED.><THE OPERATOR OF A CENTRALINK DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONTACTED THE SIEMENS CUSTOMER CARE CENTER (CCC) BECAUSE AN ANION GAP HAD BEEN CALCULATED FOR A PATIENT SAMPLE WHEN IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CALCULATED. THE ADVIA 1800 INSTRUMENT HAD PRODUCED A RESULT OF 7.2 FOR CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), WHICH WAS BELOW THE CO2 DETECTION LIMIT OF 10 ON THE CENTRALINK. THE CO2 RESULT WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE CENTRALINK AS <10 AND AN ANION GAP OF 25 WAS CALCULATED. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SODIUM, CHLORIDE, AND CO2 VALUES, THE CUSTOMER KNEW THAT THE RESULT OF 25 WAS INCORRECT. THE SAMPLE WAS REPEATED FOR CO2 ON THE INSTRUMENT AND RESULTED AS 6.2, WHICH WAS ALSO TRANSMITTED TO THE CENTRALINK AS <10. THE CENTRALINK PRODUCED AN INCORRECT ANION GAP VALUE OF 25 A SECOND TIME, WHICH WAS REPORTED TO THE PHYSICIAN(S). THERE ARE NO KNOWN REPORTS OF PATIENT INTERVENTION OR ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES DUE TO THE CENTRALINK DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CALCULATING AN ANION GAP RESULT WHEN IT SHOULD NOT HAVE.

4073108	0	CALIBRATION IF AFFECTED BY SOFTWARE DEFECT.><DAKO HAS FOUND A SOFTWARE DEFECT IN THE CALIBRATION ROUTINE OF DAKOLINK SOFTWARE VERSION 4.0.3, WHICH IS USED IN THE DAKO AUTOSTAINER 48. OUR INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THAT THIS MAY HAPPEN ONLY IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FOLLOWING EVENTS OCCUR IN THE ORDER LISTED BELOW: 1: DAKOLINK SOFTWARE ON THE AUTOSTAINER 48 HAS BEEN UPGRADED FROM VERSION 3.1 TO 4.0.3 AND 2) EITHER A PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE OR WASTE PUMP REPLACEMENT OF THE AUTOSTAINER 48 WAS PERFORMED DURING WHICH THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER INADVERTENTLY MOVED THE BASE PLATE, AND 3) THE BASEPLATE IS NOT COMPLETELY ALIGNED IN THESE VERY SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, THE SOFTWARE DEFECT MAY CAUSE THE AUTOSTAINER CONTROL SOFTWARE TO USE OLD CALIBRATION SETTINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS SOFTWARE VERSION 3.1, WHICH MAY LEAD TO: PREMATURE REJECTION OF REAGENT BOTTLES WHICH CAUSES THE INSTRUMENT TO SEND AN ERROR MESSAGE TO THE OPERATOR, AND THEREFORE, HAS NOT PATIENT IMPACT OR INADEQUATE ASPIRATION OF REAGENT, WHICH MAY LEAD TO COMPROMISED STAINING WHICH IF UNDETECTED BY THE OPERATOR AND/OR PATHOLOGIST COULD LEAD TO A FALSE POSITIVE OR FALSE NEGATIVE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ALL SLIDES GO THROUGH PATHOLOGIST REVIEW PRIOR TO PATIENT RESULT DETERMINATION. HOWEVER, EVEN IF THE ABOVE THREE CONDITIONS ARE MET, THE INSTRUMENT MAY PERFORM AS INTENDED. THE INTERNAL GEOMETRY OF THE DIFFERENT BOTTLES, GEOMETRY OF THE PLATE AND LOCATION OF REAGENT RACK ON THE AUTOSTAINER ARE ALSO FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER A FAILURE WILL OCCUR. NEW INSTRUMENTS ARE NO AFFECTED BY THIS SOFTWARE DEFECT AS THEY ARE MANUFACTURED WITH DAKOLINK SOFTWARE VERSION 4.0.3 AND THERE ARE NO OLD CALIBRATION SETTINGS TO WHICH THE INSTRUMENT CAN REVERT BACK. THE TOTAL AFFECTED INSTRUMENT POPULATION IDENTIFIED ABOVE (SECTION 2) WERE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THEIR SOFTWARE HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO VERSION 4.0.3 AND EITHER THE PM OR WASTE PUMP REPLACEMENT HAS BEEN PERFORMED. NOT ALL OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL MEET THE THIRD REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS POTENTIAL FAILURE BECAUSE FIELD SERVICE VISITS ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER INSTRUMENT CONTAINS THE BASEPLATE MISALIGNMENT. DAKO ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 5% OF INSTRUMENTS IDENTIFIED IN SECTION 2 ABOVE HAVE THE BASEPLATE MISALIGNMENT. THIS PERCENTAGE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT DAKO HAS INSPECTED APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED (100) IDENTIFIED INSTRUMENTS, AND ONLY FIVE (5) INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING THE BASEPLATE MISALIGNMENT.

2065353	0	AN ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) REPORTS THAT A NEW DISPENSE VERIFY TOOL, USED WITH THE PRISM ANALYZER, STARTED SMOKING IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE POWER CORD WAS PLUGGED INTO AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET. THE TOOL HAD NOT BEEN CALIBRATED AND NO LIQUID HAD BEEN DISPENSED INTO THE CUPS. THE FSE IMMEDIATELY UNPLUGGED THE TOOL FROM THE OUTLET. THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF INJURY OR DAMAGE. (B)(4). THIS INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THE ABBOTT PRISM ANALYZER PERFORMS AS INTENDED WITH RESPECT TO THIS COMPLAINT ISSUE. NO PRODUCT DEFICIENCY WAS IDENTIFIED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO ASSIST THIS COMPLAINANT OR THE ENTIRE CUSTOMER BASE OTHER THAN TO CONTACT THEIR AREA REPRESENTATIVE(S). THIS INVESTIGATION DOCUMENTS THE ISSUE OF SMOKE WITH THE ABBOTT PRISM DISPENSE VOLUME TOOL ONLY. THE RETURNED DISPENSE VOLUME TOOL (L/N 1G40-26, S/N (B)(4); DEVICE MANUFACTURE DATE 03/11/2010) WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND THE FOLLOWING WAS OBSERVED: ONE CAPACITOR (LABELED C9) ON THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD INSIDE THE TOOL HAD FAILED; THIS WAS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE SMOKE THE FSR OBSERVED. AN EVALUATION OF THE CAPACITOR DETERMINED IT WAS THE CORRECT TYPE AND IN THE CORRECT ORIENTATION. FLAMMABILITY: ENCAPSULATED MATERIALS MEET THE UNDERWRITER LABORATORIES FLAME RATING UL94 V0. THIS RATING STATES THAT THE CAPACITOR WILL SELF-EXTINGUISH AFTER THE IGNITION SOURCE IS REMOVED. COMPLAINT ACTIVITY WAS REVIEWED AND IDENTIFIED NO ADVERSE TRENDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE ISSUE CURRENTLY UNDER EVALUATION. THE ABBOTT PRISM OPERATIONS MANUAL (L/N 1G40-47) CONTAINS INFORMATION TO ADDRESS THE CUSTOMER'S CURRENT ISSUE. THIS IS AN ISOLATED EVENT INVOLVING A PRISM DISPENSE VOLUME TOOL.

3068310	0	THE PT WAS IN A LUNG TREATMENT AND WAS TREATED WITH A VARIAN 2100CD, 80 MLC DIRECTLY WITH SKIN ON THE COUCH TOP. THE KIND OF TREATMENT WAS STATIC (AP/PA). DURING THE TREATMENT, THE COUCH TOP CAUSED THE PT TO GOT A INCORRECT DOSE TREATMENT AND HAS MOIST DESQUAMATION. TREATMENT REGION WAS LUNG. RADIATION ENERGY AND MODALITY OF 18 MEV X-RAY. FIELD SIZE WAS 15 X 15 CM2. PT RECEIVED A CUMULATIVE DOSE FROM 7020 CGY, THIS IS A DOSE PER FRACTION OF 180 CGY. DOES PER FIELD WAS 90 CGY. THE MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE COUCH TOP IS, LIKE E.G. SIEMENS, SINMED AND Q-FIX, A SOLID CARBON FIBRE COUCH TOP WITHOUT A TENNIS RACKET AREA. IT FULFILLS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ALUMINUM EQUIVALENT ACCORDING TO 21 CFR SEC 1020.30. ALL CARBON FIBER TABLETOPS RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN PT SKIN DOSE AND ALL ARE AWARE OF THE INCREASE IN DOSE. THIS DESIGN ENABLE S A HIGHER STABILITY FOR THESE COUCH TOPS AND MINIMIZES ANY SAGGING OF THE PT, WHICH CAN OCCUR WITH TRADITIONAL TENNIS RACKET INSERTS OR FOIL AND A NOTABLY IMPROVEMENT IMAGING QUALITY, COMPARED TO TENNIS RACKET TYPES. OVER THE COMPLETE TREATMENT AREA, SOLID CARBON FIBER COUCH TOPS DO NOT HAVE A HIGHER DOSE ATTENUATION COMPARED TO TENNIS RACKET AREAS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIGHER ATTENUATION CAUSED BY THE SOLID CARBON FIBRE COUCH TOPS THERE IS A, IN COMPARISON, NOTABLY HIGHER SKIN DOSE. EVEN VERY THIN CARBON FIBER SOLID INSERTS, TO BE PLACED IN THE TENNIS RACKET AREA, HAVE AN NOTABLE EFFECT ON SKIN DOSE UP TO 70% RELATIVE SURFACE DOSE. SAME CAN BE NOTED WITH SEVERAL STATE OF THE ART IMMOBILIZATION DEVICES. CORRESPONDING MONTE CARLO CALCULATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS EFFECT TO SKIN DOSE CAN BE DECISIVELY COMPENSATED ONLY BY TENNIS RACKETS. THEREFORE, ALL SOLID CARBON FIBRE COUCH TOPS CAN BE STATED TO SHOW SIMILAR EFFECTS. THE EFFECT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ADAPTION OF TREATMENT TECHNIQUES. SHOULD THE USER EMPLOY THE SAME TECHNIQUES AS FOR A COUCH TOP WITH TENNIS RACKET, SKIN REACTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. OPPOSITE, COUCH TOPS WITH A TENNIS RACKET AREA HAVE MASSIVE FRAME STRUCTURES, WHICH HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN TREATMENT PLANNING AS WELL. THIS IMPOSES THAT COUCHTOPS MAY NOT BE TREATED "AS AIR" .

THE CUSTOMER REPLACED THE DAMAGED PROBE AND SUBSEQUENT INSTRUMENT OPERATIONS AND TEST RESULTS WERE ACCEPTABLE. THE CUSTOMER REQUIRED NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE. A REVIEW OF THE INSTRUMENT SERVICE HISTORY DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY OTHER ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM. THE INVESTIGATION CONSISTED OF A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT ACTIVITY FROM (B)(6) 2009 AND IDENTIFIED NO ADVERSE TRENDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE ISSUE CURRENTLY UNDER EVALUATION. THE AEROSET OPERATIONS MANUAL, LIST NUMBER 9D06-05, CONTAINS INFORMATION ADDRESSING THE CURRENT CUSTOMER ISSUE. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION WAS NOT IDENTIFIED.

4297378	0	ON (B)(4) 2014, BIOMERIEUX WAS INFORMED THAT THE RESULTS OF NEGATIVE BACT/ALERT TESTS WERE ATTACHED TO THE IMPROPER PATIENT. BASED O THE DATA BACKUP THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED, THE HOSPITAL LIS (NOT A BIOMERIEUX PRODUCT) ASSIGNED THE SAME ACCESSION ID TO 2 PT SAMPLES WITHIN A 90 MINUTE PERIOD OF TIME. UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS, ACCESSION IDS ARE UNIQUE TO THE PT BEING TREATED. THIS ALLOWS FOR THE DATA TO BE PROCESSED AND ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPER PATIENT RECORD WITHIN THE SYSTEMS. THE REPORTED EVENT SUGGESTS THE SYSTEM MAY HAVE MALFUNCTIONED; THEREFORE, AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN INITIATED. BASED ON THE DATA BACKUP PROVIDED THE BOTTLES INVOLVED WERE LOADED ON (B)(6) 2014. ALL BOTTLES INVOLVED WERE DETERMINED TO BE NEGATIVE; THEREFORE, NOT IMPACTING PT TREATMENT OR SAFETY IN THIS CASE. FOR POSITIVE SAMPLES, THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE INDICATE THAT THE SAMPLE SHOULD BE SUB-CULTURED TO CONFIRMED BACTERIAL GROWTH. DURING THIS TIME, GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE, INCLUDING THOSE AT THE COMPLAINT'S SITE, WOULD CONFIRM THE PT ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSITIVE BOTTLE. ALTHOUGH THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CONFIRMED POSITIVE SAMPLE BEING ACTED ON BY A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL IS REMOTE, IF GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE IS NOT OBSERVED IT IS POSSIBLE WERE THIS MALFUNCTION TO RECUR. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS AND THE RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS WILL BE DOCUMENTED IN A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH REPORT.

3251970	0	ON (B)(6) 2013, BIOMERIEUX BECAME AWARE OF A PATIENT DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH A FALSE NEGATIVE BACT/ALERT BPA RESULT FOR A POOLED PLATELET SAMPLE. THE PATIENT HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PANCYTOPENIA, NEUTROPENIA AND LEUKEMIA, AND WAS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR >1 MONTH. THE PATIENT RECEIVED A TRANSFUSION OF FOUR-DAY-OLD POOLED PLATELETS (B)(6) 2013 AT 22:00, AND WENT INTO SEPTIC SHOCK. TESTING OF THE PATIENT'S BLOOD DETECTED STREPTOCOCCI GROUP A. THE PATIENT DIED (B)(6) 2013 AT 12:50. INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AT (B)(6) ISOLATED THE CAUSE TO AN ASYMPTOMATIC BLOOD DONOR WHO HAD A RESPIRATORY INFECTION 1-2 WEEKS PRIOR TO BLOOD DONATION. THE DONOR HAD STREPTOCOCCI GROUP A. FURTHER TESTING OF ALL PRODUCTS PRODUCED WHICH CONTAIN THIS DONORS BLOOD WERE POSITIVE FOR STREPTOCOCCI GROUP A. THE CUSTOMER'S SAMPLE PROCESSING PROCEDURE INDICATES TO WAIT 24 HOURS BEFORE REMOVING THE SAMPLE FROM THE POOLED PLATELETS; HOWEVER, IN THIS CASE, THE SAMPLE OF 8-10ML FROM A FIVE-DONOR PLATELET POOL WAS REMOVED AT 18 HOURS. THE ASSOCIATED BACT/ALERT BPA BOTTLE CONTAINING THE POOLED PLATELETS REMAINED "NEGATIVE" FOR THE MAXIMUM MONITORING PERIOD OF 7 DAYS. AS INDICATED IN THE PACKAGE INSERT, A REPORT OF "NEGATIVE" SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT IS STERILE. THE NEGATIVE STATUS COULD BE DUE TO UNDER-INOCULATION OF THE BOTTLE, NO ORGANISMS PRESENT IN THE INOCULUM, THE NUMBER OF ORGANISMS WERE TOO SMALL FOR DETECTION, OR A CULTURE BOTTLE/MEDIUM THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF THE ORGANISM. FOR BEST OVERALL RECOVERY WHEN CULTURING PLATELET SPECIMENS IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CULTURE BOTTLE BE UTILIZED (E.G., ONE AEROBIC AND ONE ANAEROBIC). THE PACKAGE INSERT ALSO STATES THAT MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CULTURE BOTTLE SHOULD BE USED WHEN CULTURING PLATELET SPECIMENS (E.G. ONE AEROBIC, ONE ANAEROBIC CULTURE BOTTLE) FOR BEST OVERALL RECOVERY. IN THIS CASE, THE CUSTOMER ONLY USED AN AEROBIC (BPA) BOTTLE WHEN CULTURING THE PLATELET SPECIMENS. AS PART OF THE BIOMERIEUX INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, THE SUBMITTED BACT/ALERT INSTRUMENT DATABASE WAS REVIEWED AND THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF INSTRUMENT ERRORS OR OPERATOR ERRORS THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. (B)(4). A REVIEW OF THE BATCH RECORD AND QC TESTING RESULTS FOR BACT/ALERT BPA CULTURE BOTTLE, LOT NUMBER 1032201, BY BIOMERIEUX, DID NOT REVEAL ANY ABNORMALITIES OR INDICATORS OF PRODUCT NON-CONFORMITY. THERE WERE NO DISCREPANCIES IN THE QC RELEASE DATA, AND THE RESULTS WERE WITHIN THE IDENTIFIED SPECIFICATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT DETECT A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION OR PRODUCT ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BACT/ALERT INSTRUMENT OR BACT/ALERT BPA CULTURE BOTTLE, LOT NUMBER 1032201 ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COMPLAINT. THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE PACKAGE INSERT ARE ADEQUATE AND CORRECTLY INFORM THE CUSTOMER OF PRECAUTIONS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF AN ADVERSE EVENT. THIS EVENT IS BEING REPORTED AS AN ADVERSE EVENT BECAUSE THERE IS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO CLEARLY SEPARATE THE BPA RESULT AND THE PATIENT DEATH.

5343898	0	in 1999, clarify case was submitted to the american red cross (arc) to report an issue with group operations. when group operations was used to add a donation property(gatx) to a series of whole blood numbers (wbns), the property should have automatically been applied to every component for that donation. instead, group operation did not add the property to all components. upon investigation, it was discovered that group operations will only add donation properties to in-house components (e.g. not shipped). for example, assume a wbn is collected and red cell and platelet components are produced. the components are tested and determined to be suitable for release and the platelets are shipped to a customer, while the red blood cells remain in house. subsequently, a (b)(6) property (unsuitable for release) is added to the wbn through group operations. if the platelets are then returned, they would not receive the (b)(6) property and would be allowed to be shipped. in summary, if the shipped component is returned to inventory, there is no computer mechanism to prevent re-issuing of the component. due to the fact that configurable donation properties that are designed to prevent release would not have been added to shipped products, american national red cross (arc) believe this should have been reported. donation properties should be added to every component for the donation, regardless of whether a component has bee shipped.><arc sent a blood services letters (bsls) ((b)(4)) to inform regions of the issue and instructed the regions not to use group operations to add donation properties to any donations that had shipped components. the bsl was issued in may 1999. in addition a record review was performed to ensure that no erroneous releases were identified. the result of this review found that no erroneous releases occurred and no units were required to be recalled. the root cause of this defect is in the original software received from (b)(4) in 1996. the design and functionality did not include adding a donation property to a component that had been shipped when applied using group operations. a change request ((b)(4)) was developed to modify group operations functionality to add donation properties to all components for a donation, including shipped components. this change was delivered by minor software patch, s1364 to all regions by september 8, 1999.

WE HAD BEEN USING A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE PHILIPS INTELLIVUE SYSTEM. SINCE THE UPGRADE, IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT THE SYSTEM WILL SOMETIMES BE UNABLE TO CONNECT TELEMETRY MONITORED PATIENTS TO THE CENTRAL STATION. THIS WILL OCCUR WHEN THE PATIENT IS BEING ADMITTED, OR WHEN THE BATTERY IS CHANGED IN THE TELEMETRY TRANSMITTER. MOST FREQUENTLY, THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN THE BATTERY IS REPLACED IN THE TELEMETRY TRANSMITTER. THE TRANSMITTER BATTERY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED TWICE PER DAY. THE MP5T BEDSIDE MONITORS WILL DETECT THE SIGNAL FROM THE TELEMETRY TRANSMITTER, BUT THE SIGNAL IS NOT SENT TO THE CENTRAL STATION. THIS LEAVES THE PATIENT UNMONITORED AT THE CENTRAL. THE NURSE REPLACING THE BATTERY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AT THE CENTRAL, SINCE THE BEDSIDE MONITOR IS ABLE TO CONNECT. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH PHILIPS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. MANUFACTURER RESPONSE FOR CENTRAL STATION, PIIC IX (PER SITE REPORTER): PHILIPS IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON DETERMINING THE CAUSE OF THE ISSUE.

ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD APPLICATION RELATED TO ALLERGY DATA RECEIVED VIA INTERFACE FROM THE CUSTOMER'S ENTERPRISE INFO SYSTEM, WHICH WAS 'CODED' USING A 3RD PARTY DRUG DATABASE TERMINOLOGY NOT SUPPORTED BY PICIS. THE NUMERIC CODE REPRESENTING 'CEFTRIAXONE' IN THE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM REPRESENTED A DIFFERENT ALLERGY CONCEPT IN THE PICIS' SUPPORTED THIRD PARTY DRUG DATABASE. THE SCREEN DISPLAYED THE CORRECT ALLERGY NAME OF CEFTRIAXONE TO THE PHYSICIAN, BUT THE BACKGROUND ALLERGY CHECKING LOGIC (DETERMINED BY THE NUMERIC CODE SENT FROM THE INTERFACE) DID NOT NOTIFY THE PHYSICIAN OF A POTENTIAL ALLERGY INTERACTION, WHEN A MEDICATION ORDER FOR ROCEPHIN WAS WRITTEN. THE PT WAS GIVEN THE MEDICATION WHILE IN THE ED. THE PT DID NOT HAVE ANY ADVERSE REACTION TO THE MEDICATION. OUR INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE REASON FOR NO ALLERGY INTERACTION NOTIFICATION WAS A RESULT OF ALLERGIES CODED USING A NON-SUPPORTED EXTERNAL DRUG DATABASE SCHEMA BEING SENT TO ED PULSECHECK FROM THE ENTERPRISE INFO SYSTEM. PICIS IS WORKING WITH THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW ALLERGY CODES SENT PRIOR TO JUNE 2010 TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL ERRONEOUS ALLERGY CODES STORED IN THE DATABASE. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE SIMILAR CUSTOMER SITE CONFIGURATIONS WITH DISPARATE DRUG DATABASES. OF THESE SITES, TWO HAVE REPORTED THIS CONCERN TO PICIS, ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN SUBMITTED IN AN EARLIER REPORT. WE ARE WORKING WITH EACH OF THESE CUSTOMERS TO PREVENT UNSUPPORTED ALLERGY CODES FROM BEING SENT TO THE PICIS APPLICATION.

5731224	0	leica biosystems received a complaint that tissue samples processed in both retort a and b of peloris tissue processor serial number (b)(4) were over-processed"; and as a consequence  the instrument had temporarily been taken out of service. the complainant also reported that a wax seal was torn. on-site assessment of the operation and function of the instrument was conducted by a (b)(6) field service engineer (fse) on (b)(6) 2016. the fse noted that reagents on the instrument at the time of the complaint had been replaced on (b)(6) 2016. on (b)(6) 2016  the fse was advised by the complainant that the quality of tissue processing from a validation run(s) performed subsequent to fse attendance at the laboratory using non-diagnostic tissue samples was satisfactory. on (b)(6) 2016  information provided by the complainant to a (b)(6) field support specialist indicated that tissue from one (1) case involved in this event was not diagnosable and re-biopsy of the patient had been recommended. however  (b)(6) biosystems (b)(6) received information on (b)(6) 2016 that re-biopsy of the patient was not required because the pathologist was able to make a diagnosis after the tissue was re-cut.><a code recorded at 19:09pm and 19:10pm on (b)(6) 2016 indicates that the protocol being scheduled by the user could not be run because the final cassettes processed threshold for ipa had been exceeded. the following information was displayed on both occasions: "final cassettes processed threshold for ipa exceeded; processing quality may be compromised - 1 run(s) remaining. replace least pure ipa station  bottle 9." a code recorded at 19:13pm on (b)(6) 2016 indicates that bottle 9 (ipa) was not in contact with the corresponding sensor for three (3) seconds  which is less than the minimum period configured of 20 seconds; and the station was reset to 100%. resetting a reagent station sets the concentration to the default value configured in the reagent types definition unless an alternative value is entered into the instrument software by the user; and resets the number of cassettes processed and the number of cycles and days to zero. the properties of the reagent in bottle 9 prior to this action were: ipa concentration=92.5%  cycles=61  cassettes=4433 and days=36. the reagent in bottle 9 (ipa) was used for the first time in the final dehydration/clearing step of the "factory 2 hr xylene free reduced heat" protocol started in retort a at 19:14pm on (b)(6) 2016; and was subsequently also used for the final dehydration/clearing step of the "factory 2 hr xylene free reduced heat" protocols started in retort a at 18:02pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort b at 19:47pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 15:08pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 18:19pm on (b)(6) 2016 and in retort b at 19:09pm on (b)(6) 2016. it was determined that the quality of tissue processing from the "factory 2 hr xylene free reduced heat" protocols started in retort a at 19:14pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 18:02pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort b at 19:47pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 15:08pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 18:19pm on (b)(6) 2016; and in retort b at 19:09pm on (b)(6) 2016 would have been adversely affected by the incorrect user action of resetting the station properties for bottle 9 (ipa) at 19:13pm on (b)(6) 2016 without replacing the reagent. although the user affirmed in the instrument software that the reagent concentration in bottle 9 (ipa) was to be set to default value of 100% at 19:13pm on (b)(6) 2016  the actual concentration of reagent in bottle 9 (ipa) remained unchanged at 92.5% because the bottle had not been removed from the instrument for sufficient time to replace the reagent. the instrument software uses reagent concentration to select reagent stations when a protocol is scheduled. the reagent station with the lowest (in-threshold) concentration of a reagent group or type is selected for the first step using that reagent group or type; and reagent stations of increasing concentration are used for the succeeding processing steps of the reagent group or type. reagent with the highest concentration is always used for the final processing step of a reagent group or type before changing to another reagent group or type. as a consequence  bottle 9 (ipa) was used in the final dehydration/clearing step of the "factory 2 hr xylene free reduced heat" protocols started in retort a at 19:14pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 18:02pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort b at 19:47pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 15:08pm on (b)(6) 2016; in retort a at 18:19pm on (b)(6) 2016 and in retort b at 19:09pm on (b)(6) 2016. the minimum final reagent concentration required for isopropanol is 95%. the consequences of using reagent at a concentration less than the minimum required for the final dehydration/clearing step in a protocol is re-introduction of water into the tissue which cannot be displaced in subsequent processing steps; and contamination of reagents used in the subsequent processing steps  ultimately resulting in sub-optimal tissue processing. the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported was a use error  which occurred at 19:13pm on (b)(6) 2016. specifically  a user failed to complete manual replacement of the reagent in bottle 9 (ipa) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions detailed in the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual; which contains the following specific warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss.""

THIS DESIGN ALLOWS TWO DISTINCT SOURCES OF ERROR. FIRST, THERE IS NO CONSISTENT WAY TO VIEW ORDERS FOR MEDICATIONS. A MEDICATION ORDER CAN DISPLAY EITHER IN A PLAN, SUB-PLAN, OR UNDER THE ORDERS TAB. IN ORDER TO FIND A GIVEN MEDICATION, CERNER MANDATES THAT YOU CLICK THROUGH EACH AND EVERY PLAN. THIS FACILITATES DUPLICATION OF BOTH MEDICATION AND NON-MEDICATION ORDERS (THERE IS A MEDICATION CHECKER WHICH IS SO POORLY DESIGNED AND DOES LITTLE TO AID THE PHARMACISTS IN DETECTING DUPLICATE MEDICATIONS). SECOND AND MORE DANGEROUS, HIGH RISK INTRAVENOUS MEDICATIONS CAN BE RUN EITHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE PLAN. CERNER PROGRAMMING DOES NOT KEEP HIGH RISK MEDICATIONS IN A CONSISTENT SPOT. IT IS VERY EASY TO STOP MONITORING FOR HEPARIN (WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE HEPARIN PLAN) WHILE CONTINUING THE HEPARIN (WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE PLAN) OR VICE-VERSA. AS YOU CAN PROBABLY GUESS, WE FORMED MULTIPLE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES. I WAS THE LEAD PHYSICIAN ON THE ORDERS TEAM. ALTHOUGH WE WERE UNABLE TO REDUCE THE ERROR RATE, IT IS NOT CLOSE TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL. AGAIN, I BELIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN OF THE CERNER PRODUCT WHICH IS WHY I CHOSE TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION. WITH ISSUES THIS COMPLEX, I AM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT "SEEING IS BELIEVING." IF DESIRED, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ARRANGE A WEB CONFERENCE TO DEMONSTRATE MY CONCERNS. 
5136655	1	><DOCTOR WAS PERFORMING SURGERY ON PATIENT AND THE ANESTHESIA MACHINE COMPLETELY QUIT WORKING. THE CRNA QUICKLY STARTED TO MANUALLY BAG THE PATIENT AND GIVE HIM SUPPLEMENTAL IV PROPOFOL TO KEEP THE PATIENT SEDATED FOR THE SURGERY. THE SCREEN THAT GIVES ALL THE READING ON HOW MUCH ANESTHESIA IS BEING ADMINISTERED WENT COMPLETELY BLANK WITH AND ERROR NUMBER. THE CRNA TURNED THE MACHINE POWER BUTTON OFF AND THEN TURNED IT BACK ON AND THE MACHINE BEGAN TO WORK AGAIN. CRNA WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE PATIENT SAFE BY BAGGING THE PATIENT AND GIVING SUPPLEMENTAL SEDATING MEDICATION TO KEEP THE PATIENT SEDATED UNTIL THE MACHINE DID POWER BACK UP AND CRNA WAS ABLE TO FINISH THE ANESTHESIA FOR THIS PATIENT. GE WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED AND THEY SENT A REPAIR TECH OUT THE NEXT DAY AND REPLACED THE POWER CONTROLLER BOARD AND POWER SUPPLY IN THE MACHINE. MANUFACTURER RESPONSE FOR ANESTHESIA MACHINE, AISYS CS2 (PER SITE REPORTER): THEY IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A FSE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.

THE LAB STAFF COMPLAINED THAT THE CABLE WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND THAT IS WHY THE CABLE BROKE. THE BS-ECG TRUNK CABLE WAS USED FROM THE SAVE THE CASE KIT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY REPORTED IN THIS PROCEDURE. UPON REQUEST, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED ON THE EVENT. THE ISSUE OCCURRED PROBABLY DURING PRE-OP BUT REALIZED IT WHEN THEY STARTED THE PROCEDURE BECAUSE THE SIGNALS WERE NOISY. THE NOISE OCCURRED ON ALL THE CHANNELS, INCLUDING THE 12 LEADS OF BS ECGS AND ALL IC (INTRACARDIAC) RECORDINGS. THE NOISE OCCURRED ON BOTH THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM AND THE EP RECORDING SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME. THE NOISE WAS QUITE DISTURBING AND BECAUSE THEIR NEXT PATIENT WAS A VT PATIENT, THEY SAID THEY NEED MUCH CLEARER SIGNALS TO BE CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO EVALUATE THEM. THE PHYSICIAN WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE WITH THE NOISE BECAUSE OF HIS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND BEING ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE THE NOISE FROM NORMAL POTENTIALS. PER THE SEVERITY OF THE NOISE ON ALL SIGNALS ON BOTH THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM AND THE RECORDING SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME IS INDICATIVE OF A REPORTABLE EVENT.

4810638	0	ON (B)(6) 2015, A LEICA FIELD SERVICE SPECIALIST (FSS) MEASURED THE ETHANOL CONCENTRATION IN BOTTLE 5 USING A HYDROMETER. THE MEASURED ETHANOL CONCENTRATION IN BOTTLE 5 WAS 84.5%; AND THE ETHANOL CONCENTRATION CALCULATED BY THE INSTRUMENT SOFTWARE WAS 99.7%. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION BY LEICA BIOSYSTEMS FOUND THAT THE REAGENT IN BOTTLES 5 AND 14 WAS REPLACED PRIOR TO THE PROCESSING PROTOCOLS FROM WHICH SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING WAS REPORTED. BOTTLE 5 WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE FINAL DEHYDRATION STEP OF BOTH THE PROCESSING PROTOCOLS FROM WHICH SUB-OPTIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING WAS REPORTED. THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE MEASURED AND CALCULATED ETHANOL CONCENTRATION IN BOTTLE 5 INDICATES THAT A USE ERROR OCCURRED WHEN REPLACING THIS REAGENT. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THIS COMPLAINT REQUIRED REPORTING TO THE FDA AS A PRODUCT PROBLEM MALFUNCTION BASED ON THE TWO (2) YEAR PRESUMPTION RULE FOR THE MOST RECENT COMPLAINT WITH THE SAME ROOT CAUSE. INVESTIGATION OF THIS COMPLAINT BY LEICA BIOSYSTEMS REMAINS IN PROGRESS.><LEICA BIOSYSTEMS RECEIVED A COMPLAINT REGARDING SUB-OPTIMAL PROCESSING OF TISSUE SAMPLES FROM TWO (2) PROCESSING RUNS USING THE 2HR GI BIOPSY PROTOCOL, WHICH WERE STARTED ON (B)(6) 2015. A LEICA FIELD SUPPORT SPECIALIST REPORTED THAT: THEY DESCRIBED THE BLOCKS AS POORLY INFILTRATED PER TAC. BOTH POORLY PROCESSED RUNS WERE REPROCESSED ON THE LAB'S VIP PROCESSOR AND APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. TISSUE STATUS IS STILL PENDING PATHOLOGIST'S REVIEW. I WILL BE VISITING THE SITE ON (B)(6) TO INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE OF THE POOR PROCESSING. THE CUSTOMER NOTED THAT THEY DID CHANGE A FEW PARAFFIN STATIONS IN A VERY UNCONVENTIONAL MANNER. THE SITE INDICATED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE A PARAFFIN DRAIN HOSE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME NECESSARY TO REMOTE DRAIN THE PARAFFIN BATH. THEY STATED TO ME THAT THEY "SCOOPED" PARAFFIN MANUALLY OUT OF THE APPROPRIATE BATH AND REFILLED THE BATH WITH NEW PARAFFIN." ON 13 MAY 2015

3007396	1	A DISCORDANT, FALSELY LOW BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (BNP) RESULT WAS RELEASED FOR A PATIENT SAMPLE AFTER ERROR MESSAGES FROM THE ADVIA CENTAUR CP INSTRUMENT WERE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE (B)(4) LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM (LIS), WHERE THEY WERE MISINTERPRETED. THE ADVIA CENTAUR CP INSTRUMENT PRODUCED ERROR MESSAGES INDICATING THAT THE THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT SAMPLE VOLUME AND THAT THE TASK WAS NOT COMPLETE. THE LIS MISINTERPRETED THESE ERROR MESSAGES, AND A RESULT WAS GENERATED AND RELEASED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE DISCORDANT RESULT WAS REPORTED TO THE PHYSICIAN(S). THE SAMPLE WAS RERUN ON AN ALTERNATE INSTRUMENT, AND A HIGHER RESULT WAS OBTAINED. THE LABORATORY THEN RAN TWO "TEST" SAMPLES FOR TROPONIN AND BNP TO SEE IF THE ISSUE WAS REPRODUCIBLE. FOR BOTH SAMPLES, RESULTS WERE GENERATED DESPITE THE INSTRUMENT TRANSMITTING ERROR MESSAGES TO THE LIS. THERE ARE NO KNOWN REPORTS OF PATIENT INTERVENTION OR ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES DUE TO THE DISCORDANT BNP AND TROPONIN RESULTS. THE LIS VENDOR HAS CHANGED HOW THE LIS PROCESSES NON-NUMERIC RESULTS FROM THE ADVIA CENTAUR CP INSTRUMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN NO REOCCURRENCES OF THIS ISSUE SINCE THE LIS PROGRAMMING WAS CHANGED. THE SIEMENS INSTRUMENTS ARE PERFORMING ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. NO FURTHER EVALUATION OF THIS DEVICE IS REQUIRED.
2059702	0	CUSTOMER REPORTED UNEXPECTED NEGATIVE REACTIONS WITH THE ANTIBODY SCREENING ASSAY ON THE GALILEO ECHO INSTRUMENT. THE RESULT IMAGE FILES WERE REVIEWED BY AN IMMUCOR TECHNICAL SPECIALIST. THE RESULTS VISUALLY APPEARED POSITIVE WHILE THE INSTRUMENTS INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS WAS NEGATIVE. CUSTOMER WAS INFORMED OF THE NEED TO VISUALLY VERIFY ALL NEGATIVE ANTIBODY SCREENING AND IDENTIFICATION RESULTS. AN IMMUCOR SERVICE ENGINEER ALSO EVALUATED THE INSTRUMENT. AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, THE CAMERA MODULE WAS REPLACED; PERFORMED SERVICE ADJUSTMENTS AND CHECKS; PERFORMED QC; AND OBSERVED SEVERAL TESTS WITHOUT ERROR. THE INSTRUMENT IS OPERATING AS EXPECTED.
2104960	0	THE CUSTOMER HAD REPORTED FALSE POSITIVE REACTIONS CAUSED BY CARRY OVER. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED A POSITIVE BIOTESTCELL 2 CELL SCREENING RESULT FOR CAP SURVEY SAMPLE JAT-2 AND THE RESULT BACK FROM CAP IS THAT THE RESULTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE. CELL 1 WAS 3+ AND CELL 2 WAS 1+, PANELS WERE RUN AND AGAIN JAT-2 WAS RUN IMMEDIATELY AFTER JAT-1 AND THE FIRST 4 CELLS OF THE PANEL FOR JAT-2 WERE POSITIVE. CAP SURVEY SAMPLE JAT-1 WAS RUN IMMEDIATELY BEFORE JAT-2 AND JAT-1 WAS VERY STRONG >4000 TITER ANTI-D. THE CORRECT FUNCTION OF THE AFFECTED LOTS OF REAGENTS WERE PROVED BY TESTING THE RETENTION SAMPLES OF QUALITY CONTROL LABORATORY ON TANGO. ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REACTIONS WERE CORRECT. WE DIDN'T OBSERVE ANY FALSE POSITIVE REACTIONS. A REVIEW OF THE BATCH RECORD DOCUMENTATION SHOWED NO IRREGULARITIES WHICH MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY THE QUALITY OF THE COMPLAINED LOTS. IN GENERAL CARRY-OVER EVENTS CANNOT BE EXCLUDED IF APPLYING INSTRUMENTATION WITH A DESIGN LAYOUT, THAT IS AMONGST OTHERS, ALSO TRUE FOR TANGO OPTIMO. THIS MATTER IS ALSO DISPLAYED IN ITS SPECS. DESPITE COATED NEEDLES AS WELL AS RINSING STEPS, SUCH A PHENOMENON MAY OCCUR IN VERY RARE CASES, IS USUALLY BASED ON A SAMPLE-SPECIFIC REACTION AND CAN BE CAUSED BY A HIGH PROTEIN LEVEL IN PLASMA (INDUCED BY SEVERE SICKNESS OR APPLICATION OF DRUGS) OR ANTIBODIES WITH A HIGH TITRE. SINCE ANY SPECIMEN BEING CONSPICUOUS DUE TO A POSITIVE ABS RESULT SHOULD UNDERGO RETESTING AND BECAUSE ANY ABS-POSITIVE SAMPLE FROM A BLOOD DONOR SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM TRANSFUSION, NO SERIOUS THREAT NEITHER FOR PT NOR USER OR DEVICE MAY ARISE DUE TO A CARRY-OVER EVENT. IN ACCORDANCE TO THE RESULTS OBTAINED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE, TESTING AT BMD CONFIRMED A CARRY-OVER EVENT FROM ONE WELL INTO THE FOLLOWING ONE OCCURRING DURING SEQUENTIAL PIPETTING OF DIFFERENT BLOOD PLASMA CAUSED BY THE HIGH TITRE OF ANTIBODY PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE. EACH PIPETTING STEP OF INDIVIDUAL SAMPLES IS FOLLOWED BY A RINSING STEP OF THE CORRESPONDING NEEDLE RESULTING IN A DILUTION OF BIOLOGICAL RESIDUES BY APPROX. 1:1000. IN GENERAL THIS DILUTION FACTOR IS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT A DETECTABLE TRANSFER OF MATERIAL INTO THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN.

TESTING PERFORMED WITH RETENTION ANTI-A, LOT 101673, 101674 WITH IN HOUSE DONOR SAMPLES REVEALED TYPE A RED CELL STICKING IN THE ANTI-A WELLS. TO PREVENT THE STICKING, IN HOUSE STUDIES FOUND THAT PIPETTING THE REAGENTS INTO THE WELLS BEFORE THE SAMPLE RED CELLS GREATLY REDUCED THE STICKING. IN HOUSE COMPARISON TESTING OF THE NEW REAGENT-FIRST PIPETTING ORDER TO THE EXISTING SAMPLE-FIRST PIPETTING ORDER SHOWED NO UNEXPECTED NEGATIVE ANTI-A REACTIONS WITH THE NEW PIPETTING ORDER. SOME UNEXPECTED NEGATIVE REACTIONS WERE OBSERVED DURING TESTING WITH THE CURRENT ASSAY. CUSTOMERS WERE NOTIFIED OF THE MODIFICATION TO THE ASSAY ON 9/20/07.THIS FACILITY DID HAVE THE MODIFIED ABO ASSAY SOFTWARE INSTALLED. ACCORDING TO THE GALILEO OPERATOR MANUAL, FORWARD ONLY ABO-RH TESTING HAS A HIGHER RISK OF MISTYPE DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE REVERSE TYPE RESULTS. HAZARDOUS MISTYPES MAY OCCUR, SUCH AS AN A SAMPLE BEING INTERPRETED AS A GROUP AB, OR AN RH (D) NEGATIVE SAMPLE BEING INTERPRETED AS RH(D) POSITIVE.  FOR THIS REASON, ABO-RH RESULTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE COMPARED TO THE PATIENT OR DONOR'S HISTORY.

5038574	0	I AM A (B)(6) YEAR OLD MALE AND TAKE PRESCRIPTION BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION DAILY. I AM ALSO A STROKE SURVIVOR FROM A MAJOR STOKE IN 2009 DUE TO BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA; NOT A FLOW ISSUE. TODAY AT 9:15 AM I WAS CHECKING MY BLOOD PRESSURE. I USE AN OMRON BP791IT (HEM-7222-ITZ) MONITOR. IT IS SET TO TAKE MY BLOOD PRESSURE VIA THREE COMPUTERIZED MEASUREMENTS AND AVERAGE. TODAY, IT TOOK THE FIRST READING AND THEN DEFLATED THE CUFF AND RESTARTED AFTER 30 SECONDS. THAT IS NORMAL. THE SECOND READING BEGAN AND WAS OBTAINED AND THE MACHINE STOPPED AS USUAL. THEN AFTER 5 SECONDS WHILE THE CUFF WAS STILL FULLY INFLATED THE MACHINE TURNED ITSELF ON AGAIN AND BEGAN INFLATING THE CUFF WHICH WAS ALREADY FULLY INFLATED. I KIND OF FROZE AS I WAS STARTLED AND IN SHOCK AS THE PRESSURE KEPT INCREASING SUCH THAT IT WAS APPROACHING 275 ON THE MONITOR. AT THAT POINT MY ARM MUSCLE WAS IN PAIN AND IT SNAPPED ME OUT OF MY TRANCE SO I RIPPED THE CUFF OFF FROM MY ARM YET THE MACHINE CONTINUED TO INFLATE THE CUFF FOR ANOTHER (APPROXIMATELY) TEN SECONDS UNTIL IT REPORTED A READING ERROR CODE (E5) WHILE THE CUFF RESTED ON THE TABLE. THE E5 CODE MEANS THAT CLOTHING INTERFERED WITH THE READING AND THE MACHINE STOPPED. I WAS NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHING (SHIRT) TODAY NEAR THE ARM AND I USE THIS MACHINE DAILY AND THE MACHINE STOPPED WHILE NOTHING WAS INSERTED INSIDE THE CUFF EXCEPT AIR. I AM IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE AS THE BLOOD PRESSURE ISSUE IS RELATED TO A TIGHTENED LUNG AS A RESULT OF ASTHMA. HOWEVER, I DID 75 ARM CURLS YESTERDAY WITH A 10 POUND DEAD WEIGHT SO MY MUSCLE WAS TIGHT TODAY. POSSIBLY THAT CONFUSED THE MACHINE? IF I WAS OLDER THAT MACHINE WOULD HAVE PHYSICALLY HURT SOMEONE. I AM LUCKY I SNAPPED OUT OF MY SHOCK TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND TORE THE CUFF OFF MY ARM. I WAS ACTUALLY MESMERIZED THAT THE MACHINE TURNED ITSELF BACK ON AS I WATCHED THE UPPER BLOOD PRESSURE NUMBER ON THE MONITOR APPROACH 275. THIS MACHINE IS FROM HELL AND YOU NEED TO REALLY LOOK INTO IT. WE PURCHASED IT IN (B)(6) 2013. (B)(4).

(BEC) REPORTING THAT THEIR COULTER LH 750 SLIDEMAKER WAS MAKING SLIDES WITH BLOOD ON THE SLIDE LABEL (CONTAINED TO THE LABEL ONLY, NOT INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE INSTRUMENT). THE CUSTOMER TRIED FLUSHING THE DISPENSE PROBE BUT THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. NO PATIENT RESULTS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND SMEARS ARE BEING MADE WELL. THE OPERATORS WERE WEARING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) CONSISTING OF A LAB COAT, EYE WEAR AND GLOVES AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. NO INJURY OR EXPOSURE WAS REPORTED. A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WENT ON-SITE THE DAY OF THE EVENT AND FOUND SPECIMEN BLOOD MIGRATING ONTO LABEL. UPON EXAMINING THE UNIT, FSE FOUND THE PROBE TRUCK NOT EVACUATING PROPERLY. FSE VERIFIED OPERATION OF ASSOCIATED VALVES, FLUSHED VACUUM PATHWAY AND CLEANED DISPENSE PROBE AREA. THE REPAIRS PERFORMED BY THE FSE RESOLVED THE LEAK. PER FSE, WHILE PROBE WAS BACKWASHING INTO PROBE WASTE CUP, THE CUP WAS NOT DRAINING FLUID AS FAST AS IT NORMALLY WOULD DUE TO A PARTIALLY BLOCKED VACUUM PATHWAY, CAUSING THE WASTE TO STAY LONGER IN THE CUP AND THEREFORE WICK ONTO THE BOTTOM OF DISPENSE PROBE MECHANISM, WHICH WOULD THEN TRANSFER ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE LABEL.

2027921	1	IN OUR RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, A SOFTWARE UPGRADE WAS PERFORMED ON THE PHILIPS COMPUTED RADIOGRAPHY (PCR) ELEVA FROM VERSION PCR 1.1.5 TO PCR 1.2.  THIS UPGRADE WAS PERFORMED, BEGINNING IN LATE FALL OF 2010.  ON THE NEW 1.2 VERSION, THERE IS A SMALL SYMBOL THAT TRANSFERS OVER TO THE PACS (PICTURE ARCHIVE AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS).  OUR CONCERN WITH THIS FEATURE IS THE ICON CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR THE MARKER DENOTING THE PATIENT'S RIGHT (R) SIDE. ON CERTAIN RADIOGRAPHIC VIEWS, WE UTILIZE AP-PA MIRRORING IN CONJUNCTION WITH A HANGING PROTOCOL.  IN THE MIRRORING PROCESS, THE ICON COULD BE PLACED ON THE  PATIENT'S LEFT SIDE, BUT YOU SEE THE R MIRROR ICON.  IN OUR PRACTICE, THE TECHNOLOGISTS PLACE THE APPROPRIATE LATERALITY "L" OR "R" MARKER ON THE CORRECT SIDE, BUT ON PACS THERE ALSO IS THE MIRROR ICON THAT COULD BE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PATIENT.  THIS IS OF CONCERN TO US AS RADIOLOGISTS, SURGEONS, CLINICIANS MAY NOT KNOW THIS IS AN AP-PA MIRROR ICON AND MAY MISTAKE THE ICON FOR THE WRONG SIDE OF THE PATIENT'S BODY.  AS OF (B)(6), 2011 THE AFFECTED FEATURES HAVE BEEN TURNED OFF AND SOME SYSTEMS REVERTED TO PRIOR SOFTWARE.DETAILED INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY HAVE INDICATED THEY ARE WORKING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.

2913061	1	ISSUE: WHEN USING THE ROCHE COBAS E411 (RCHCE4LI) DRIVER VERSION 8.00.0001 OR 8.00.0002, WITH INSTRUMENT MANAGER, IF THERE IS A BARCODE READ ERROR, THE CURRENT SAMPLE MAY BE IDENTIFIED AS THE LAST SAMPLE ID THAT WAS IN THAT RACK/DISK POSITION, POTENTIALLY CAUSING SAMPLE MISMATCH. IF THE LAST SAMPLE HAD ANY PENDING TESTS IN THE ORDERS DATABASE, TEST SELECTION WOULD BE DOWNLOADED TO THE INSTRUMENT WITH THE INCORRECT SAMPLE ID, AND RESULTS WOULD REPORT ON THE WRONG SAMPLE. ISSUE DETAILS: LIS DOWNLOADED A TEST ORDER (TEST ID (B)(6)) IN DUPLICATE FOR SAMPLE 1. SAMPLE 1 WAS LOADED TO POSITION 3 OF A RACK/DISK 123, THE INSTRUMENT QUERIED IM AND RECEIVED AN ORDER FOR TEST ID (B)(6). THE INSTRUMENT RAN THE TEST AND CORRECTLY GENERATED AND REPORTED A RESULT. LATER, SAMPLE 2 IS PLACED IN POSITION 3 OF THE RACK/DISK 123, BUT WHEN THE INSTRUMENT TRIED TO READ IT, THERE WAS A BARCODE READ ERROR AND IM DOWNLOADED THE PENDING TEST FOR SAMPLE 1. THIS BARCODE ERROR CAUSED IM TO INCORRECTLY IDENTIFY THE SAMPLE BASED ON THE RACK/DISK AND POSITION WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSED THE INSTRUMENT TO RUN TESTS ON THE SAMPLE INCORRECTLY AND RESULTS REPORTED WITH THE WRONG SPECIMEN. THERE WAS A BUG IN V8.00.0001 AND V8.00.0002 OF THE DRIVER. THIS BUG WAS IDENTIFIED, CORRECTED AND RELEASED BEFORE THIS CUSTOMER COMPLAINT OCCURRED. WHEN THE ORIGINAL BUG WAS REPORTED, NO PATIENT SAFETY CONCERNS WERE RAISED AT THAT TIME. THE PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE WAS NOT BROUGHT TO DATA INNOVATION¿S ATTENTION UNTIL AFTER THE PATCH WAS RELEASED. THIS RESULTED IN A DELAY IN REPORTING THE ISSUE TO THE FDA IN A TIMELY MANNER. A CAPA INCIDENT IS BEING OPENED TO DETERMINE WHY THE PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED SOONER. ACTIONS TAKEN: SITE REPORTING THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN CONTACTED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUE, AND INFORMED OF THE SOLUTION TO USE TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM. THE DRIVER HAS BEEN CORRECTED AND WAS RELEASED SEPTEMBER 14, 2012. THE SOFTWARE PATCH IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FROM OUR WEBSITE, AS PER OUR ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES. AN EMAIL DESCRIBING THIS ISSUE AND RESOLUTION WAS SENT TO THE CUSTOMER BASE AFFECTED BY THIS ISSUE ON (B)(4) 2012.

THE DME STATED THAT THE MOTHER OF THE INFANT ADMINISTERED CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) AND THE EQUIPMENT DID NOT ALARM. THE REPORTED EVENT OCCURRED ON (B)(6), 2011 AT 10:15 AM. THE MANUFACTURER RECEIVED THE DEVICE FOR EVALUATION AND DID NOT CONFIRM THE CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT OF THE UNIT NOT ALARMING. THE INFANT APNEA MONITOR WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED AND TESTED BY THE MANUFACTURER USING A SIMULATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SMARTMONITOR 2 CHECKOUT PROCEDURE MANUAL (PN 1020817). THE INFANT APNEA MONITOR DETECTED AND ALARMED APPROPRIATELY FOR SIMULATED EVENTS AND PASSED ALL REQUIRED TESTING. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 WAS SET UP WITH A 20 SECOND DELAY BEFORE ANNUNCIATING AND RECORDING AN ALARM FOR AN APNEA CONDITION. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 WAS PROGRAMMED WITH PARAMETERS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE FOR RECORDING AND ALARMING FOR RESPIRATION AND HEART RATE EVENTS DURING INFANT MONITORING. FURTHERMORE, THE INFANT APNEA MONITOR'S MEMORY DATA WAS DOWNLOADED AND ANALYZED BY TRAINED ASSOCIATES. THE DOWNLOADED MEMORY REVEALED THE APNEA MONITOR WAS NOT IN USE DURING THE TIME OF THE REPORTED EVENT. THE DEVICE WAS TURNED OFF ON (B)(6), 2011 AT 3:59:05 AM AND NOT TURNED BACK ON UNTIL (B)(6), 2011 AT 1:30:52 PM. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 DEVICE IS NOT INTENDED TO PREVENT LOSS OF BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY. THE SMARTMONITOR 2 PARENTS' GUIDE (PN 572-4000-00) FURTHER STATES: "THE SMARTMONITOR 2 IS A MONITORING DEVICE ONLY. IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE LOSS OF BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY, NOR WILL IT RESTORE BREATHING OR HEART ACTIVITY. IT WILL NOT PREVENT DEATH. ANYONE USING THE SMARTMONITOR 2 TO MONITOR AN INFANT SHOULD BE TRAINED IN CURRENT INFANT CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR), WHICH IS THE PROPER WAY TO RESTORE BREATHING AND HEART ACTIVITY." ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A DEATH REPORTED, THE MANUFACTURER CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVICE DID NOT CAUSE NOR CONTRIBUTE TO THE INFANT DEATH. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM THE ALLEGATION OF ALARM FAILURE DURING A PATIENT EVENT AND DETERMINED THAT THE DEVICE WAS NOT IN USE DURING THE PATIENT EVENT. THE MONITOR PASSED ALL REQUIRED TESTING AND DETECTED AND ALARMED APPROPRIATELY FOR SIMULATED EVENTS. BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE MANUFACTURER CONCLUDES THAT THE DEVICE DOES FUNCTION TO SPECIFICATION AND THAT NO FURTHER ACTION IS APPROPRIATE.
3339297	1	THE PT WAS RECOVERING FROM SEPSIS, ACUTE KIDNEY, RESPIRATORY, AND HEART FAILURE. SUBTLE, BUT SUDDEN CLINICAL REGRESSION OCCURRED WITHOUT THE TRADITIONAL SIGNS OF SEPSIS OR GENITOURINARY INFECTION. URINE AND BLOOD CULTURES WERE ORDERED. THE CPOE OF THE EHR COMPUTER HAD CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS). THE CDS DEVICE AUTOMATICALLY DISCONTINUED THE URINE CULTURE AND ORDERED A URINALYSIS ON THE DOCTORS' TWO ATTEMPTS TO ORDER THE DISEASE CRITICAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. APPROX 4 DAYS PASSED AND THERE STILL WAS NOT A URINE CULTURE, WHILE THE PT SLIPPED BACK IN TO KIDNEY FAILURE, RESPIRATORY FAILURE, AND PULMONARY EDEMA AND WAS PLACED BACK ON THE VENTILATOR. FINALLY, SEVERAL MORE DAYS LATER, A URINE CULTURE WAS DONE SHOWING >100,000 GRAM NEGATIVE RODS, THAT THEN GREW OUT OF THE BLOOD CULTURE. THE DELAY IN DIAGNOSIS WAS DIRECTLY A RESULT OF THE CDS USURPING THE ROLE OF DOCTOR, COUNTERMANDING TESTS. THIS CDS DEVICE DOES NOT HAVE ANY FUNCTIONAL OVER RIDE TO GET THE URINE CULTURE DONE. DEATH FROM THE DELAY IN DIAGNOSING AND TREATING SEPSIS WAS NARROWLY AVOIDED. THE CDS DEVICE IS DEFECTIVE IN SO FAR AS IT DOES NOT PERMIT AN OVER RIDE, EVEN IF IN THE BEST JUDGEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN.

2021340	1	FOUR PORTABLE CHEST IMAGES OF THE PT WERE PERFORMED. DURING EACH INSTANCE, A DELAY OF IMAGES ARRIVING TO THE AGFA PACS OCCURRED. THE CLINICAL CONSEQUENCE WAS A DELAYED DIAGNOSIS ON (B)(6) WHILE THE PT WAS IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. THERE WERE OTHER DELAYS ON (B)(6) DURING ROUTINE RADIOGRAPHIC MORNING ROUNDS. THE PT EXPIRED OVER THE WEEKEND; HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO (B)(6) MED CTR, THE DELAY DID NOT IMPACT THE PT'S ULTIMATE OUTCOME (THE CHILD EXPIRED), AND DID NOT CAUSE A DELAY IN RECEIVING ANY SPECIFIC MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS. SEVERAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSE TO THE INCIDENT AND AGFA HEALTHCARE IS ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING EACH ONE. EVAL SUMMARY: ON (B)(6) 2011, AN EMAIL ESCALATION WAS RECEIVED FROM THE (B)(6) MED CTR INDICATING THAT A PROBLEM HAD OCCURRED WITH THE IMPAX 6.3.1 SU 16 (PACS SERVER). DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES TAKEN OF A CHILD WERE DELAYED. OVERALL, A DELAY TIME BETWEEN 45-60 MINUTES FROM THE TIME SOME OF THE FILMS WERE TAKEN TO THE TIME THE PICU TEAM WAS ABLE TO VIEW THE RESULTS. ACCORDING TO (B)(6) (MED CTR) - THIS DELAY DID NOT IMPACT THE PT'S ULTIMATE OUTCOME (THE CHILD EXPIRED) AND DID NOT CAUSE A DELAY IN RECEIVING ANY SPECIFIC MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS. DETERMINATION OF CAUSE: THE DEVICE IN QUESTION (IMPAX 6.3.1 SU 16) WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE PRODUCT PROBLEM. AGFA HEALTHCARE IS CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE. THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT MAY RESULT IN IMAGES NOT ALWAYS BEING AVAILABLE IN A TIMELY FASHION FOR VIEWING ON THE IMPAX CLIENT. ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONTINUE TO BE EXPLORED: DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES WITH DATA MIGRATED FROM LEGACY GE PACS. MIGRATION TECHNIQUES.

1048323	0	INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: THE CUSTOMER REPORTED DISCREPANT RESULTS GENERATED FOR 3 PT SAMPLES WHEN TESTED USING THE ARCHITECT BHCG ASSAY. THE COMPLAINT TEXT INDICATES THAT THE ANALYZER PERFORMED WELL DURING THE DAY WITHOUT ERROR AND CONTROLS RUN DURING THE DAY WERE ACCEPTABLE. WHEN THE SAMPLES GAVE THE INITIALLY LOW RESULTS, THEY WERE RERUN AND RECOVERED SIMILARLY LOW VALUES, WHICH WERE REPORTED. THE RESULT FOR ONE OF THE SAMPLES WAS QUESTIONED SO THE SAMPLES WERE REPEATED GETTING DIFFERENT VALUES. THE TEXT INDICATES THAT ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS WERE REPORTED THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT AS THE ERROR WAS CAUGHT QUICKLY AND REPORTED TO THE PHYSICIANS QUICKLY. PER THE TEXT ENGINEERING CHANGED THE BUFFER CONTAINER, CHECKED THE PROBES AND DRAIN SENSORS AND THE INSTRUMENT WORKED. THE TECHNICAL MARKETING REP (TMR) ALSO VISITED THE SITE. THE TMR INSPECTED THE INSTRUMENT LEARNING THAT DURING THE NIGHT SHIFT THE TECHNOLOGIST BENT THE R2 PROBE BUT REPLACED IT WITH THE STAT PROBE. THE TMR INSTALLED A NEW REAGENT PROBE, RECALIBRATED BOTH PROBES AND RAN THE CONTROLS. THE TMR ALSO PERFORMED AN INTERNAL DECONTAMINATION. THE TMR ALSO RECOMMENDED THE TECHNOLOGISTS RUN CONTROLS EACH SHIFT SAMPLES ARE PROCESSED. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR ARCHITECT ISYSTEM WAS PERFORMED FOR THE TIME PERIOD 10/01/2007 THROUGH 05/15/2008. THE INSTRUMENT WAS INSTALLED AT THE SITE IN JANUARY 2008 AND SINCE THAT TIME NO OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE WERE FOUND. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS LOGGED AGAINST EQUIPMENT SUBTYPE 116 AND LN 7K78 WAS PERFORMED FOR THE TIME PERIOD 10/01/2007 THROUGH 05/15/2008. THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW IDENTIFIED OTHER COMPLAINTS, WHICH DESCRIBE THE ARCHITECT ISYSTEM GENERATED DISCREPANT OR DISCORDANT RESULTS FOR THE ARCHITECT BHCG ASSAY. THE REVIEW DID NOT FIND THAT THE COMPLAINTS IDENTIFIED A DEFICIENCY OF THE PRODUCT OR THAT THE PRODUCT WAS PERFORMING OUTSIDE ITS INTENDED USE. THE EVENT IS ADDRESSED IN LABELING OF THE ARCHITECT TOTAL B-HCG PACKAGE INSERT LN 7K78 INDICATES THAT ADEQUATE LABELING IS PROVIDED RELATED TO THE CUSTOMER'S OBSERVATION. REFER TO THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: QC PROCEDURES INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE. FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES, HCG RESULTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER DATA; E.G., PT'S MEDICAL HISTORY, SYMPTOMS, RESULTS OF OTHER TESTS, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, ETC. ECTOPIC PREGNANCY CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM NORMAL PREGNANCY BY HCG MEASUREMENTS ALONE. AT 10, 11 THE RESULTS FROM THIS OR ANY OTHER DIAGNOSTIC KIT SHOULD BE USED AND INTERPRETED ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL CLINICAL PICTURE. IF THE HCG LEVEL IS INCONSISTENT WITH, OR UNSUPPORTED BY, CLINICAL EVIDENCE, RESULTS SHOULD BE CONFIRMED BY AN ALTERNATE HCG METHOD. THIS MAY INCLUDE THE QUALITATIVE TESTING OF URINE. AT 25 THE ABSENCE OF URINARY HCG MAY SUGGEST A FALSELY ELEVATED SERUM RESULT. RESULTS MAY ALSO BE CONFIRMED BY PERFORMING SERIAL DILUTIONS OF THE SAMPLE. USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, SAMPLES THAT CONTAIN INTERFERING SUBSTANCES EXHIBIT NONLINEAR RESULTS WHEN DILUTED. THE ABBOTT ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL (JUNE, 2007) INDICATES THE FOLLOWING UNDER SECTION 7, OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS, 'LIMITATIONS OF RESULT INTERPRETATION' THAT ASSAY RESULTS MUST BE USED WITH OTHER CLINICAL DATA, FOR EXAMPLE, SYMPTOMS, OTHER TEST RESULTS, PT HISTORY, CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, INFO AVAILABLE FROM CLINICAL EVAL, AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES. ALL DATA MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR PT CARE MANAGEMENT. IF ASSAY RESULTS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL EVIDENCE, ADD'L TESTING IS SUGGESTED TO CONFIRM THE RESULT. THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR ITS INTENDED USE. HOWEVER, ERRORS CAN OCCUR DUE TO POTENTIAL OPERATOR ERRORS AND ARCHITECT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY LIMITATIONS. THE OPERATIONS MANUAL ALSO INCLUDES A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE THAT THE PROBE TIP IS BENT OR DAMAGED UNDER SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS, OBSERVED PROBLEMS 'ERRATIC ASSAY RESULTS (I SYSTEM)'. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE EVENT WAS EVALUATED. A REVIEW OF MECHANISM AND PERFORMANCE TESTS WAS PERFORMED. LABELING WAS REVIEWED. INTERMITTENT FAILURE OF THE REAGENT PROBE WAS DISCOVERED AND REPLACED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. USE ERROR ALSO MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ISSUE, AS THE CUSTOMER APPEARS TO HAVE REPLACED A REAGENT PROBE WITH A STAT PROBE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE INSTRUMENT. NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. END OF REPORT. SEE SCANNED PAGE. >< THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT DISCREPANT RESULTS WERE GENERATED FOR PT SAMPLES WHEN USING THE ARCHITECT BHCG ASSAY. (MIU/ML) INITIAL RESULT: <1.20. REPEAT RESULT: 99760.

POST-PURGE SATURATIONS¿ SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT AFTER AN LRS PURGE, THE LRS CHAMBER HAS RE-FILLED WITH WBCS BEFORE EXPECTED BY THE TRIMA ACCEL SYSTEM. PLASMA LINE OCCLUSIONS¿ SIGNALS IN THE RDF SUGGEST THAT THE PLASMA LINE WAS PARTIALLY OCCLUDED DURING A PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE. THIS CAN CAUSE FLOW THROUGH THE LRS CHAMBER TO BE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, DECREASING THE HOLDING CAPACITY OF THE LRS CHAMBER. OTHER EVENTS ¿ THESE CAN INCLUDE; CENTRIFUGE STOPS, MULTIPLE ACCESS ALARMS & FLOW ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A NON STEADY STATE CHAMBER CONDITIONS, AND RBC SPILLOVERS WHICH CAN POSSIBLY LEAD TO A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT.

(B)(6) CAN BE REACHED AT (B)(6). I WILL CALL THIS SCENARIO #3 TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL LIFE THREATENING FLAWS AS DISCUSSED IN SCENARIO #2. IN THIS EXAMPLE, A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE IS USED AS OUTLINED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL ON PAGE ONE AND PAGE 2 TO VERIFY FETAL HEART TONES. FROM 1645 UNTIL OFF THE MONITOR AT 1711, THIS IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A NORMAL LOOKING FETAL MONITOR STRIP THAT IS UNEVENTFUL. BUT UPON PLACING THE PT BACK ON THE FETAL MONITOR, THERE IS ERRATIC SIGNALS FROM THE ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER. AT 1740-1741, A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE WAS PLACED AS OUTLINED AT THE TOP OF PAGE 2 OF THE PHILIPS CLASS 2 RECALL. AT 1745, NOTICE HOW THE SCALP ELECTRODE WAS REGISTERING A FETAL HEART RATE 140-150'S THEN SUDDENLY DROPS TO MATERNAL HEART RATE. HOWEVER, AN INTERESTING FEATURE OCCURS. NOTICED AT 1746 AND 1748 HOW THE FETAL HEART RATE TRACING MIMICKS THE MATERNAL HEART RATE WITH AT LEAST A 20 BEAT DIFFERENCE FROM THE MATERNAL HEART RATE THAT IS IN THE 60'S WHICH IS WHY THE CCV SYSTEM WAS NEVER ENABLED. -BECAUSE MOM'S PULSE WAS BELOW 100- AT 1752, IT IS OBVIOUS THE -FSE- FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE IS PICKING UP A GOOD FETAL SIGNAL AND GOES ON TO DELIVER W/O INCIDENT. SO THIS REINFORCES THE QUESTION AGAIN. DOES THE CCV SYSTEM BECOME DISABLED OR CONTINUE TO BE ENABLED WHEN A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE IS USED BECAUSE NOWHERE IN THE MANUAL OR CLASS 2 RECALL IS THIS QUESTION ANSWERED? ALSO, WHEN IT IS CLEAR THAT THE "CCV" SYSTEM IS NOT ENABLED AS WHEN THE MATERNAL HEART RATE WAS IN THE 60'S-NOT ABOVE 100 TO EMPLOY THE CCV SYSTEM- THERE IS A CLEAR 20 BEAT MIMICKING SEPARATION WITH THE VERIFICATION OF FETAL HEART TONES WITH A FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE, SO AS TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT GREATER THAN THE CLASS 2 RECALL DISCUSSED 10-15 BEAT DIFFERENCE ON PAGE ONE OF THE CLASS 2 RECALL, CAN ACTUALLY BE GREATER WHETHER THE "CCV" SYSTEM IS ENABLED OR NOT? DATES OF USE: (B)(6) 2009 - (B)(6) 2010.><ADDITIONAL INFO RECEIVED FROM THE REPORTER ON 12/24/2013: THIS REPORT IS A FOLLOW UP REPORT TO REPORTS I MADE TO THE FDA IN 2011. I FEEL DEEPLY COMMITTED AS I HAVE STUDIED THE AVALON FETAL MONITORING SYS FOR 4 YEARS NOW AND WITH 22 YEARS OF LABOR AND DELIVERY EXPERIENCE, I HAVE BECOME AN EXPERT ON THE AVALON FETAL MONITORING SYS. THIS REPORT IS A CULMINATION OF SOME OF THE INFO I FOUND REGARDING THE PHILIPS AVALON FETAL MONITORING SYS ON THE MAUDE WEBSITE. I WAS SO THANKFUL TO SEE THAT THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM WRITER FROM (B)(4) HAD DEVELOPED AN UPGRADE 3/18/2011 AND FIELD ORDER TO UPGRADE ALL THE UNITS IN MAY OF 2011. TESTING IN AUGUST 2011 SHOWED "THAT THE MATERNAL PULSE RATE OBTAINED FROM THE TOCO MP TRANSDUCER HAS BEEN RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THE ECG DERIVED MATERNAL HEART RATE." FROM THAT REPORT IN AUGUST OF 2011, IT APPEARS THAT THE FETAL HEART RATE WAS ACCURATE NOW COMPARED TO THE MATERNAL HEART RATE AS PREVIOUSLY STATED IN THE CLASS 2 RECALLS IN SEPTEMBER OF 2009. I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE INACCURACIES LEADING TO AN UNNECESSARY CESAREAN SECTION MAY HAVE BEEN PERFORMED DUE TO THE FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODE AS WELL. SO MY QUESTION HERE IS: WAS THIS FETAL MONITORING UNIT ALREADY SERVICED WITH THE FIELD ORDER TO UPGRADE ALL THE UNITS IN MAY OF 2011? IF SO, THEN PLEASE REFER TO REPORT #(B)(4) AND REPORT #9610816-2011-00335 TO SEE IF THE CCV SYSTEM WAS EMPLOYED IN BOTH SYSTEMS AFTER MATERNAL HEART RATE IN BOTH REPORTS IS GREATER THAN 100 BEATS PER MINUTE AND DOES THE "CCV" DERIVED FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE MONITOR TRACINGS HAVE ALSO BEEN CORRECTED IN THAT AUGUST 2011 REPORT? IN THE CLASS 2 RECALL, DATED 09/04/2009, PHILIPS DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AT EMPHASIZING CONFIRMATION OF FETAL LIFE BY USE OF DOPPLER, FETOSCOPE ULTRASOUND AND FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODE. IN THE NEXT SERIES OF MAUDE REPORTS THAT I WILL LIST, PLEASE NOTE THAT THEY ARE SIMILAR REPORTS IN THAT THE SAME ISSUES ARE CLAIMED WITH FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODES IN THE CASES OF DEMISE FETUSES AND UNNECESSARY CAESAREAN SECTIONS DUE TO FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODE INACCURACIES, HAVE THESE FETAL MONITOR TRACINGS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE "CCV" SYSTEM IS EMPLOYED DURING THE USE OF THE FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODE IN EACH REPORT? PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE ARE JUST SOME OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE MAUDE WEBSITE. MANY OF SUCH OCCURRENCES MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN REPORTED TO THE FDA AS THESE TYPES OF DELIVERIES ARE USUALLY RECORDED AS IUFD (INTRAUTERINE FETAL DEMISE). I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF NOT THOUSANDS OF THESE TYPES OF DELIVERIES SINCE THE 1970'S. THESE EVENTS ARE WHERE A SPIRAL ELECTRODE HAS REGISTERED A NONVIABLE FETAL HEART RATE THROUGH A DEAD FETUS THAT IS ACTUALLY RECORDING THE MOTHER'S HEART RATE USING ANY FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM, NOT JUST THE PHILIPS AVALON FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM. REPORT NUMBER, REPORT DATE: 9610816-2013-00131, 06/13/2013; 9610816-2009-00205, 08/12/2009; 9610816-2009-00206, 10/19/2009; 9610816-2010-00042, 01/07/2010; 9610816-2011-00335, 05/27/2011; 9610816-2011-00345, 06/08/2011; 9610816-2005-00113, 04/01/2005; 9610816-2005-00115, 04/01/2005; 9610816-2006-00115, 03/08/2006; 9610816-2006-00244, 07/05/2006. ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS IF THE SPIRAL ELECTRODE COMPONENT OF THE AVALON FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM HAS THE PATENT TO THE SPIRAL ELECTRODE WITH ANOTHER COMPANY? OR PHILIPS?. AS THE PREVIOUS COMPANY (B)(4) DID NOT HAVE THE PATENT TO THE SPIRAL ELECTRODE IN 1991, MY PERSONAL VERY FIRST FETAL MONITORING CLASS. IF SO, ARE THE FLAWS IN THIS SEPARATE COMPONENT NOT OWNED BY PHILIPS? IT IS DEFINITELY CLEAR IN THE MAUDE REPORTS THAT PHILIPS IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THEIR AVALON FETAL MONITORING SYS. I FEEL THAT PHILIPS IS NOT ALWAYS TO BLAME IN THOSE REPORTS FOR THE FETAL DEATHS DESCRIBED IN THOSE SAMPLE MAUDE REPORTS. BUT RATHER THAT SOME OF THOSE FETAL DEATHS ARE PERHAPS A PHENOMENA WHERE THE FETUS IS NOT ALIVE BUT UPON PLACING A FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODE ON A DEAD FETUS, OUR TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCED TO THE POINT IT WILL SEARCH FOR A BABY HEART RATE AND THEN REGISTER MOM'S HEART RATE AS IT IS THE ONLY HEART RATE THE FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE DETECTS. I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING A FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODE REGISTER THROUGH AN UNBORN DEAD BABY AND REGISTER THE MOTHER'S HEART RATE. THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION OF FETAL HEART TONES AS THIS IS NOT COMMON PRACTICE EVEN THOSE MANY YEARS AGO. EVEN THOSE BABIES NOT YET DEAD BUT WITH A HEART RATE LESS THAN 30.. THE FETAL SPIRAL ELECTRODE WILL NOT PICK UP THE FETAL HEART RATE LESS THAN 30. BUT IF DETECTED AN EMERGENCY CESAREAN SECTION COULD SAVE A BABIES LIFE JUST BY VERIFYING THE BABY HEART RATE WITH DOPPLER, ULTRASOUND, OR FETOSCOPE. IN DEFENSE FOR PHILIPS THEY SHOULD NOT BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE LACK OF CONFIRMATION OF FETAL LIFE BEFORE EVEN TURNING ON THE PHILIPS AVALON FETAL MONITORING SYSTEM AMONG THE CLINICIANS WHICH ARE MANY THAT DON'T PRACTICE CONFIRMATION OF FETAL LIFE. THROUGH THE USE OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT TEACH FETAL MONITORING SUCH AS (B)(6), INFANT LIVES COULD BE SAVED AS UPON PLACING A SPIRAL ELECTRODE ON ANY FETUSES THAT IT MUST BE 100% VERIFIED WITH DOPPLER, ULTRASOUND OR FETOSCOPE. THIS IS NOT HOW CLINICIANS CURRENTLY PRACTICE. WE RELY ON MACHINES TOO MUCH TO TELL US AN INFANTS STATUS. THE EFFECTS OF SUCH AN EVENT ON THE FAMILY IS DEVASTATING TO BE IN LABOR FOR HOURS THINKING YOU HAVE A LIVE BABY ONLY TO FIND OUT YOUR BABY IS DEAD WHEN IT'S BORN. ALSO TO THE CLINICIANS THAT MAY HAVE PTSD AFTER SUCH AN EVENT. WHEN I USE THE WORD CLINICIANS THROUGHOUT THIS REPORT.. THESE NEW STANDARD OF CARE SUGGESTIONS ARE FOR NOT JUST HOSPITALS BUT HOME BIRTHS AND MIDWIFE BIRTHING CENTERS AS WELL AS ACROSS OUR NATION BUT GLOBALLY AS WELL. THROUGH THE USE OF FETAL MONITOR INSTRUCTORS, ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS (B)(6) AND PERHAPS PHILIPS COULD AID IN EDUCATING CLINICIANS ACROSS THE NATION TO BRING UP THE STANDARD OF CARE TO PREVENT THESE SITUATIONS FROM REPEATING. (B)(6) COULD TAKE THE INITIATIVE LIKE THE SUCCESSFUL 39 WEEK INITIATIVE, BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT SAVING INFANT LIVES. SIMPLY BY CONFIRMING FETAL HEART RATE BY USING 2 METHODS NOT JUST ONE TECHNOLOGY. BEFORE EVER PLACING MOM ON EXTERNAL FETAL MONITOR AND VERIFY AGAIN IF INTERNAL FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE IS PLACED. VERIFY 100% OF TIME WHEN INTERNAL FETAL SCALP ELECTRODE IS PLACED. MATERNAL PULSE OXIMETER USED 100% OF TIME WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS DONE IN LABOR. CONSIDER VERIFYING EACH TIME PT OFF MONITOR. A POSITIVE CHANGE AS WE ADVANCE IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND COMPANIES SUCH AS PHILIPS WORK DILIGENTLY TO CORRECT FLAWS IN THEIR NEW "CCV" TECHNOLOGY. ANY CLINICIAN IF YOU ASK THEM AND TELL THEM THAT JUST ONE INFANT COULD BE SAVED THIS WAY BY VERIFYING FETAL HEART TONES WITH 2 METHODS INSTEAD OF ONE, ANY CLINICIAN WOULD IMPROVE THEIR FETAL MONITORING PRACTICES IMMEDIATELY. THE EMPHASIS JUST NEEDS TO BE HEARD. WHAT BETTER WAY THAN THROUGH THE FDA. AS CLINICIAN WE ARE ALL DOING WHAT WE LOVE TO DO. TO BRING NEW LIFE TO THIS WORLD SAFELY BECAUSE THESE BABIES IN THEIR OWN WAY TOUCH OUR HEARTS AND LIFE IS PRECIOUS AND SO ARE THEY. WAS TRYING TO LINK THIS REPORT TO ONE I MADE IN 2011. (B)(4) IS THE ACCESS NUMBER.

2870515	0	THE CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE THE RUN DATA FILE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE ELEVATED WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. THERE WAS NOT A TRANSFUSION RECIPIENT OR PATIENT INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE RESIDUAL WBC TESTING, THEREFORE NO PATIENT INFORMATION IS REASONABLY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. DONOR UNIT #: (B)(6). THE DISPOSABLE SET IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DISCARDED IT. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED DUE TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE RUN DATA FILE WAS ANALYZED FOR THIS EVENT. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RUN DATA FILE DID NOT FIND ANY CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT REPORTED FOR THIS COLLECTION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE NUMEROUS ACCESS PRESSURE ALERTS COULD HAVE DISRUPTED THE STEADY STATE OF THE SYSTEM AND COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. IT ALSO CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT A SAMPLING, CALCULATION, OR OTHER PROCESS ERROR COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WBC CONTENT IN THE PLATELET PRODUCT. ADDITIONALLY, BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT THAT THIS LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE COULD BE DONOR RELATED. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE IN-PROCESS. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.><(B)(4). THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS (DHR) WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS EVENT. THERE WERE NO EVENTS NOTED IN THE DHR THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELEVATED WBC COUNT EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. ROOT CAUSE: THIS DISPOSABLE SET WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED LEUKOREDUCTION FAILURE REMAINS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES WERE PROVIDED IN THE INITIAL REPORT FOR THIS EVENT.

2331604	0	A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BAXTER GLOBAL TECHNICAL SERVICES (GTS) REGARDING ASSISTANCE WITH THE HOMECHOICE (HC) UNIT DURING INITIAL DRAIN. PER THE INITIAL REPORT, HOME PATIENT (HP) HAD A SYSTEM ERROR 2240 (AIR IN THE CASSETTE). THE TECHNICAL SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (TSR) EXPLAINED THE ALARMS AND THE HP STATED SHE PRESSED GO AND WAS NOT CONNECTED. THE HP THEN CONNECTED TRYING TO RESTART THERAPY AFTER RECEIVING THE SYSTEM ERROR 2240 ALARM. THE TSR EXPLAINED TO DISCARD ALL THE SUPPLIES THE HP WOULD FINISH THE NIGHT'S THERAPY MANUALLY. GLOBAL PRODUCT SURVEILLANCE CONTACTED HP ON (B)(6) 2011. THE HP WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE THERAPY WITH NEW SUPPLIES. THE HP DID NOT NOTICE ANY DEFECTS WITH THE ORIGINAL SUPPLIES. THE HP STATED THAT IT WAS HER FAULT THAT SHE PRESSED GO BEFORE CONNECTING TO THE HC. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION REPORTED. (B)(4). THIS COMPLAINT FOR A SYSTEM ERROR (SE) 2240 (AIR IN SET) OCCURRED DURING INITIAL DRAIN IS CONFIRMED BECAUSE THE PATIENT REPORTED PRESSING GO PRIOR TO CONNECTING HIMSELF, WHICH IS A USE ERROR THAT CAN CAUSE SYSTEM ERROR 2240 ALARMS. THE HOME PATIENT (HP) STATED THAT IT WAS HER FAULT THAT SHE PRESSED GO BEFORE CONNECTING TO THE HC. THE LABEL REVIEW FOUND THE PATIENT AT HOME GUIDE TO BE ADEQUATE FOR THE USE ERROR IN THIS INCIDENT. BAXTER HAS CONDUCTED A TREND REVIEW AND FOUND THAT SIMILAR REPORTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE REPORTED PROBLEM. THIS IS BEING INVESTIGATED THROUGH CAPA. THE ASSIGNABLE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED PROBLEM WAS USE ERROR.><(B)(4).

ABBOTT CUSTOMER SERVICE INSTRUCTED THE CUSTOMER ON HOW TO ADJUST THE GAIN SETTINGS AND THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED.  THERE WAS NO ADVERSE IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED. >< (B)(4). THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT.  AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS.  A FOLLOWUP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. OTHER TEXT : AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS >< (B)(4). THE CORRECT AWARE DATE IS 3/25/2010. DURING INSTALLATION OF A CELL-DYN EMERALD AT A CUSTOMER SITE, AN ABBOTT FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) DISCOVERED THAT GAIN SETTINGS FOR THE STANDARD AND NON-STANDARD SPECIMEN TYPES DID NOT MATCH. BY DEFAULT, GAIN SETTINGS SHOULD MATCH FOR ALL SPECIMEN TYPES. CONSEQUENTLY, PATIENT SAMPLES RUN IN A NON-STANDARD SPECIMEN TYPE DID NOT MATCH RESULTS FROM THE SAME PATIENT SAMPLE RUN IN STANDARD SPECIMEN TYPE. ALL PARAMETERS CAN BE AFFECTED BY GAIN SETTING DIFFERENCES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HGB. GAIN SETTINGS CANNOT BE MODIFIED BY THE CUSTOMER, ONLY IN THE FACTORY OR BY AN FSR. QUALITY CONTROL, CALIBRATION AND GAIN ADJUSTMENT ALL USE THE STANDARD SPECIMEN TYPE ONLY. IN THE FACTORY, THERE ARE ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS TO ADJUST THE GAIN SETTINGS FOR THE STANDARD SPECIMEN TYPE AND APPLY THE ADJUSTMENTS TO ALL THE NON-STANDARD TYPES; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO VERIFICATION OF THE GAIN SETTINGS FOLLOWING ANY MODIFICATION. INVESTIGATION INTO THIS ISSUE, INCLUDING A SUPPLIER CORRECTION ACTION REPORT TO OEM, IS NOW COMPLETE. WE IDENTIFIED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ISSUE TO BE RELATED TO OEM AND ABBOTT HEMATOLOGY DOCUMENTATION AND PROCESS ERRORS, WHERE CRITICAL STEPS WERE INCOMPLETE OR INACCURATE REGARDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAIN SETTING VALUES ON THE NON-STANDARD TYPES. A PRODUCT CORRECTION LETTER, FA23MAR2010, WAS ISSUED TO ALL CURRENTLY ACTIVE CELL-DYN EMERALD CUSTOMERS, INSTRUCTING THEM TO PERFORM A REVIEW OF GAIN SETTINGS AND ADJUSTMENT WITH ASSISTANCE FROM ABBOTT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT, IF NECESSARY. ADDITIONALLY, ON 01 JULY 2010, A FOLLOW-UP PRODUCT CORRECTION LETTER, FA01JUL2010, WAS ISSUED TO ALL ACTIVE CELL-DYN EMERALD CUSTOMERS WITH A NEW SOFTWARE VERSION, WHICH ELIMINATES THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ISSUE OCCURRING.

THERE WERE NO SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCIDENT REPORTED. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT ORIGINALLY REPORTED UNDER 2028492-2012-0001 WAS DETERMINED TO BE A BUILD-UP OF DEBRIS IN THE WASTE FLUID DISCHARGE SYSTEM. A NOTIFICATION HAS BEEN SENT TO CUSTOMERS TO INFORM THEM OF THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS TYPE OF EVENT TO OCCUR, HOW TO RECOGNIZE IF THE WASTE DISCHARGE SYSTEM IS BECOMING RESTRICTED AND TO REMIND THEM TO PERFORM PERIODIC CLEANING OF THE SYSTEM.

885665	0	THE CUSTOMER STATED TEST RESULTS ON THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, SAMPLE 1 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 2, SAMPLE 2 SHOWED THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE 3, ETC. THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) GENERATED ERROR CODES 0274, TRAY IN BAY (X) WAS REMOVED BEFORE ACCESS WAS GRANTED, AND 0526, EMPTY TRAY DETECTED IN BAY (X), INDICATING THAT THE OPERATOR HAD INAPPROPRIATELY REMOVED A TRAY FROM THE RSH. CODE 0304, TRANSPORTER ERROR ALSO OCCURRED. THE RSH WENT TO STOPPED STATUS WHILE THE PROCESSING MODULE REMAINED IN RUNNING. THE OPERATOR ORDERED RERUNS FROM THE EXCEPTION SCREEN AND BEGAN TO RUN AGAIN. THE OPERATOR SUSPECTED AN ABERRANT RESULT ON A SAMPLE AND STOPPED THE RUN. REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE RESULTS WERE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT SAMPLE. SAMPLE #4 HAD THE RESULTS FROM SAMPLE #5. THE OPERATOR FOUND 28 CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES THAT WERE AFFECTED. THIRTEEN OF THE RESULTS HAD ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE DOCTOR, BUT NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED. >< THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. FOUR CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT CAN LEAD TO A STOP OF THE ROBOTIC SAMPLE HANDLER (RSH) WHEN THE SAMPLE IS PRESENTED TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE FOR ASPIRATION: REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM A ROUTINE BAY WHILE THE ACCESS INDICATOR IS AMBER; - OPENING AN RSH COVER WHILE THE RSH IS IN THE RUNNING STATE; - USER REQUESTING STOP EITHER ON THE RSH KEYPAD OR FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN ON THE SYSTEM CONTROL CENTER; - A NON-RECOVERABLE HARDWARE FAILURE OF AN RSH MECHANISM. INVESTIGATION OF THE ISSUE DISCOVERED A TIMING-DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY-REMOVAL DOES NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CLINICAL CHEMISTRY MODULE. THIS CONDITION CAUSES THE MODULE TO RECEIVE AN ERRONEOUS SAMPLE ARRIVAL FOR TESTS/SAMPLES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DELETED WHEN THE RSH NOTIFIED THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE OF THE TRAY REMOVAL ERROR CONDITION. AFTER A SUBSTANTIAL DELAY THE MODULE SENDS AN EQUALLY ERRONEOUS SAMPLE FREE MESSAGE THAT CAUSES THE RSH TO INDEX THE CARRIER TO THE NEXT POSITION. AT THAT POINT THE SEQUENCE OF SAMPLING IS OFF BY ONE CARRIER POSITION. THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED IN SOFTWARE VERSION 3.00 FOR THE ARCHITECT C16000 SYSTEM, BUT ALL SOFTWARE VERSIONS THAT SUPPORTED AN INTERFACE TO THE C8000 AND/OR THE C16000 AND RSH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS ISSUE (V2.00, V2.01, V2.02, V2.03, V2.10, V2.11, V2.20, V2.20 DB UPDATE, V2.60, V2.30, V3.00 AND V3.10). THE ISSUE CAN OCCUR ON THE C8000 AND C16000 SYSTEMS SINCE THE RSH AND THE INTERFACE SOFTWARE  ARE COMMON TO BOTH CONFIGURATIONS. THE ISSUE WAS FOUND TO BE DUE TO A TIMING- DEPENDENT DEFECT WHERE THE TRAY REMOVAL WOULD NOT CANCEL THE SAMPLE-ARRIVAL MESSAGE THAT WAS TO BE SENT TO THE CHEMISTRY MODULE. LABELING: THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL CONTAINS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE USE AND FUNCTION OF THE RSH IN SECTION 1. STATUS INDICATORS INDICATES THE STATUS OF SAMPLE PROCESSING AND WHEN THE OPERATOR CAN ACCESS SAMPLES. A STEADY AMBER LIGHT INDICATES THAT SAMPLES ARE PROCESSING AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED. SECTION 5: OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS; SUBSECTION: SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PROVIDES PROCEDURES FOR LOADING SAMPLES ONTO THE RSH FOR PROCESSING. THE PROCEDURE 'ACCESS A SAMPLE WITH TESTS IN PROCESS' ADVISES THE OPERATOR TO PERFORM THIS PROCEDURE TO SUSPEND A BAY ON THE RSH WHEN IMMEDIATE ACCESS IS NEEDED TO A SAMPLE THAT IS BEING PROCESSED. IMPROPER REMOVAL OF A TRAY FROM THE RSH WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE ERROR CODE 0273 (REMOVAL FROM THE PRIORITY BAY) OR 0274 (REMOVAL FROM THE ROUTINE BAY). THE STOPPED STATUS FOR THE RSH IS DESCRIBED IN TABLE 1.3. CONDITIONS FOR THE RSH TO BE STOPPED INCLUDE:- THE OPERATOR HAS SELECTED F6- STOP FROM THE SNAPSHOT SCREEN OR THE STOP KEY ON THE SAMPLE HANDLER KEYPAD;- ONE OF THE RSH COVERS WAS OPENED WHILE THE SAMPLE HANDLER WAS RUNNING;- SAMPLE HANDLER DETECTED A FATAL ERROR WHILE PROCESSING. THE OPERATOR IS ADVISED IN SECTION 7: OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TO 'KEEP ALL PROCESSING MODULE AND SAMPLE HANDLER DOORS CLOSED AND COVERS IN PLACE UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE IN A MAINTENANCE OR TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE' WHILE OPERATING THE SYSTEM. OPENING A COVER DURING OPERATION WILL RESULT IN THE GENERATION OF ERROR CODE 0709, RSH STOPPED, COVER OPENED. TROUBLESHOOTING ASSISTANCE FOR ALL ERROR CODES IS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS.

2116824	0	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED A NEEDLE STICK INJURY THAT OCCURRED WITH ONE OF THEIR APHERESIS OPERATORS. THE OPERATOR HAD REMOVED THE NEEDLE FROM THE DONOR'S ARM, SLID THE ANTINEEDLESTICK DEVICE OVER THE NEEDLE AND WAS REMOVING THE NEEDLE FROM THE DISPOSABLE SET TO DISCARD IT WHEN SHE INCURRED THE NEEDLE STICK. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE AREA OF THE INJURY WAS CLEANED THOROUGHLY AND THEY FOLLOWED THEIR BLOOD-BORNE PATHOGEN EXPOSURE POLICY. THE EMPLOYEE WILL BE GOING THROUGH FOLLOW-UP TESTING AND COUNSELING. THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE AGE OR WEIGHT INFORMATION. THE DISPOSABLE SET IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR INVESTIGATION. (B)(4). INVESTIGATION: THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THEIR CURRENT PRACTICE IS TO REMOVE THE NEEDLE FROM THE DONOR'S ARM, LINE UP THE WINGS ON THE BUTTERFLY NEEDLE WITH THE SAFETY DEVICE, AND THEN SLIDE THE DEVICE UP OVER THE NEEDLE. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THIS PROCEDURE IS USED SO THEY CAN BE SURE THAT THE NEEDLE HAS LOCKED INTO PLACE PROPERLY. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO RELEVANT ISSUES FOUND. ROOT CAUSE: BASED UPON THE CUSTOMER'S DESCRIPTION OF THEIR PROCESS, THE PROCEDURE FOR THE USE OF THE ANTI-NEEDLE STICK PROTECTION IS DIFFERENT THAN THE TRIMA OPERATOR'S MANUAL FOR THE USE OF THE ANTI-NEEDLE STICK PROTECTION. CONCLUSION: THE DESIGN OF THE ANTI-NEEDLE STICK PROTECTION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE TO ENSURE THAT THE OPERATOR'S HANDS DO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE NEEDLE. THE NEEDLE MAY BE ASKEW AS IT IS BEING RETRACTED, BUT THE NEEDLE WILL LOCK INTO PLACE IF THE COMPLETE PROCEDURE IS FOLLOWED. USE OF THE DEVICE OUTSIDE OF THIS PROCEDURE HAS NOT BEEN VALIDATED BY CARIDIANBCT AND MAY LEAD TO INJURY.

4508528	1	THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THERE WAS SMOKE EMANATING FROM THE B20. A FIELD ENGINEER CONFIRMED THAT THE POWER SUPPLY UNIT WAS DAMAGED, REPLACED IT WITH A NEW POWER SUPPLY UNIT AND THE B20 WORKED NORMAL. THE DEFECTIVE PART PICTURES SHOWED THE CAPACITOR C5 NEXT TO THE HEAT SINK IS SEEN BULGED WITH NO BURNT COMPONENTS. THE SUPPLIER (MEAN WELL) OF THE POWER SUPPLY PROVIDED FEEDBACK STATING THE DEFECTED CAPACITOR WAS AN ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR WHICH IS USED FOR ENERGY STORAGE AND FILTERING. THE WHITE SMOKE WAS FORMED BY EVAPORATION OF THE ELECTROLYTE WHEN THE ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR WAS BROKEN. THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THIS: 1. CAPACITOR QUALITY ISSUE; 2. INPUT VOLTAGE IS TOO HIGH. FOR CAPACITOR QUALITY, THE POWER SUPPLY UNIT HAD PERFORMED FUNCTION TEST UNDER 264VAC POWER INPUT AND BURN-IN TEST UNDER 230VAC POWER INPUT BEFORE SHIPMENT, WHICH CAN SORT THE DEFECT COMPONENT, AND CHECKED THE CAPACITOR FAILURE RECORDS OF THE SERIES MODEL. NO CAPACITOR FAILURE RECORD WAS FOUND, THUS NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW IT IS A CAPACITOR QUALITY ISSUE. FOR INPUT VOLTAGE, THE MAXIMUM INPUT VOLTAGE OF THE POWER SUPPLY UNIT IS 264V AC, AND THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE CAPACITOR IS THE VOLTAGE AFTER RECTIFIER. THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE CAPACITOR=1.414*AC INPUT VOLTAGE. THE MAX VOLTAGE ACROSS THE CAPACITOR=1.414*264=373V. THE CAPACITOR MAX VOLTAGE RATING IS 400V, THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE CAPACITOR UNDER THE RATED INPUT VOLTAGE SPEC OF THE CAPACITOR (400V). FROM THE INDIA SERVICE TEAM FEEDBACK, INDIA'S POWER GRID VOLTAGE IS 230V 50HZ AND THE POWER GRID IS UNSTABLE WHICH MAY CAUSE POWER FLUCTUATION/SURGE. ROOT CAUSE IS UNDETERMINED, THOUGH MOST LIKELY THE INPUT VOLTAGE WAS NOT STABLE WHEN THE CUSTOMER USED THE DEVICE WHICH CAUSED THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE CAPACITOR TO EXCEED THE SPECIFICATIONS, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR. IN THE USER MANUAL 2053503-002, THERE IS A CAUTION THAT: BEFORE CONNECTING POWER, CHECK VOLTAGE AND FREQUENCY RATINGS OF EQUIPMENT.><NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT. OCCUPATION OF REPORTER IS UNKNOWN.

938376	0	a non-critical alarm was occurring. the device displayed eri and indicated it should be replaced by 2009. the device was running at .175ml per day and prior to that was not at a very high flow rate. the previous eri dates looked normal with the date at the last refill being 50+ months. only indication of the event was the alarm, the patient had experienced no symptoms related to the event. the device was replaced with no complications. the medication in the pump was morphine sulphate. >< the customer contacted abbott regarding cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe used on the cell-dyn sapphire hematology analyzer. the customer reported observing 'syringe fail to home' error messages for the hemoglobin syringe. the customer stated weekly syringe maintenance procedures were followed and noticed the syringe was resistant to movement. the customer put the syringe back on the analyzer, but the abbott customer technical advocate (cta) was sending a replacement syringe. a few days later, the cta contacted the customer and verified with the customer the 'syringe fail to home' error was resolved with the installation of the replacement syringe. there was no impact to patient management reported by the customer. >< the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe is used on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer, an automated hematology analyzer. the vendor for the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number provided abbott laboratories with an improved version of the syringe, which was released for use on 05/08/2007. the vendor sent a letter to abbott stating the hemoglobin syringes with a specific manufacturing code, were assembled with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the plunger tip. the absence of sufficient lubricant causes premature failure of the syringe, which generated 'syringe failed to home' error messages upon installation on the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer or shortly thereafter. in response to the vendor's letter, abbott internal nonconformance was addressed via stock sweeps to segregate non-conforming product in inventory. a world wide quality hold was issued 22 june 2007 to remove suspect product from the distribution system and a customer letter was generated to users of the cell-dyn sapphire analyzers. the defective syringes were identified in the customer letter as those packaged and shipped between 08 may 2007 and 25 june 2007. a review of abbott's complaint analysis system from january 2007 to present did not indicate an adverse trend for hemoglobin syringes. as the affected syringes did not meet the vendor's internal lubricant requirements, the vendor provided the following corrective actions: vendor employee retraining for syringe lubricant application was completed on 06/19/2007. one hundred percent part inspection of the syringe will be performed and inspection results will be attached to the syringe shipment. abbott syringe specifications were defined for use by the vendor. certification documents are attached on every shipment of syringes. this is the final report. end of report. >< (b)(4), concomitant medical products: cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list # 8h49-02. the customer complaint was inadvertently not associated with remedial action correction 2919069-8/6/07-004-c in error. the customer used the suspect device at the customer facility. this follow up mdr for 2919069-8/6/07-004-c is submitted late. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list number 8h49-02, was manufactured on 30 april 2007 and was identified by the vendor to have been manufactured with insufficient or inconsistent amount of silicone lubricant applied to the tip of the syringe plunger. the affected syringes with a package date of 08 may 2007 through 25 june 2007, caused the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer to generate an error message upon installation of the syringe or shortly thereafter. the cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe was distributed for the cell-dyn sapphire analyzer only and did not impact other cell-dyn analyzers. the issue was resolved when a new cell-dyn sapphire hemoglobin syringe, list 8h49-04, was manufactured by a new vendor and released for distribution on 10 february 2009.
5439596	0	during review of the in-house programming/diagnostic history database, it was observed that a partial programming event occurred on (b)(6) 2008 during which the device's output current was reprogrammed from 0.5ma to 0.0ma. subsequent interrogations and a programming change are seen in the programming history and the output current was not changed from 0.0ma indicating that the provider may have intended to change the output to 0.0ma on (b)(6) 2008. the magnet output current was reprogrammed to 0.0ma on (b)(6) 2009 for an unknown reason. attempts to identify the operation of the handheld programmer on (b)(6) 2008 have been unsuccessful. the operator of the handheld programmer on (b)(6) 2009 is no longer at the facility. the patient's current providers did not have information regarding the partial programming event or the magnet disablement.><.                                                              
4902600	1	THE BUG WAS DISCOVERED DURING TESTING INTERNALLY IN THE MANUFACTURER'S FACILITY. THE BUG WAS EVALUATED TO HAVE PATIENT RISK. THE BUG CAUSES BOLD ACTIVATIONS MAPS TO BE VISUALIZED AS OVERLAYS WITHOUT TAKING THE COREGISTRATION INTO ACCOUNT. ANY OUTPUT CREATED FROM THESE ACTIVATION MAPS AS OVERLAYS WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED ACCORDING TO THE COREGISTRATION. THE BUG ONLY AFFECTS THE BOLD FMRI ANALYSIS AND NO OTHER MODULES OR ANALYSES. FURTHERMORE, THE PROBLEM WILL NOT OCCUR IF THE BOLD/DTI WIZARD IS USED, OR IF COREGISTRATION IS DONE BEFORE THE BOLD MODULE ANALYSIS IS STARTED.><DEVELOPMENT TEAM DURING INTERNAL TESTING DISCOVERED A BUG CONCERNING HANDLING OF COREGISTRATION FOR BOLD SERIES. THIS BUG WAS VERIFIED IN CURRENT VERSION 2.3.14. ALL USERS WILL BE NOTIFIED TO STOP USING THE BOLD MODULE IN NORDICICE AND CONTACT NORDICNEUROLAB FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FOR BLOCKING THE BOLD MODULE FOR FURTHER USE. AFFECTED USERS WILL BE OFFERED A TRANSITION TO NORDICBRAINEX ((B)(4)) WHICH IS OPTIMIZED FOR THE BOLD WORKFLOW. RISK EVALUATION: THE PROBLEM CAN POTENTIALLY CAUSE A MISALIGNMENT OF THE BOLD ACTIVATIONS IN RELATIONS TO THE STRUCTURAL UNDERLAY. GIVEN THAT THE HEAD MOTION CORRECTED BY THE COREGISTRATION IS USUALLY SMALL, THE EFFECT OF THIS BUG IS EQUALLY SMALL. THE MOST COMMON SIZE OF MISALIGNMENTS ARE ON THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AS THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES OF THE ANALYSIS ITSELF, WHICH MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT IS SHOULD INTRODUCE ANY ADDED RISK PATIENT HARM IN THE LAST STEP. FOR LARGER MISALIGNMENTS, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE ERROR IS NOT DETECTED BY THE USER.
